</p><p><span style="font-size: 1rem;">This is 12th Nakshatra of the zodiac ruled by Sūrya (Sun). This Nakshatra spans from 26°40' in Simha (Leo) to 10°00' in Kanya (Virgo). Thus while the first quarter of this Nakshatra falls in the sign Simha (Leo) ruled by Sūrya (Sun), the last two quarters fall in Kanya (Virgo), ruled by Buddha (Mercury). Accordingly, the characteristics of those born in the first Nakshatra are different form those born in the last three quarters.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 1rem;">Those born in the first quarter have a strong physique, good eyesight and are generally very ambitious. They do not like to be in subordinate positions for long and try to reach the highest possible position employing various means. But the efforts undertaken by these people have a certain aura of royal authority around them.&nbsp;</span><br></p><p><span style="font-size: 1rem;">In contrast, those born in the last three quarters depend more on their brain and have to make their way to the top, starting at the lowest rung. They are straight forward and do not like to be taken for granted by others. They are hard working people and once they take a decision, nobody can make them change it. They will rest only when they have finished the job in hand.&nbsp;</span><br></p><p><span style="font-size: 1rem;">Natives born in this Nakshatra are well arranged and take every step with proper planning. Those born in Leo are quick tempered and determined to achieve their objectives. But those born in Kanya (Virgo) are many times in a dilemma as to the best course of action to be taken. If the natal Buddha (Mercury) is not properly placed in case of latter class of natives, they will find problems making the right decisions.&nbsp;</span><br></p><p><span style="font-size: 1rem;">As a rule, Uttara Phalguni born enjoy a satisfactory married life and they are happy with their family.&nbsp;</span><br></p><p>
