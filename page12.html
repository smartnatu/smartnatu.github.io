</p><p><em>4th Pada: </em>The fourth pada of the Magha Nakshatra falls in the Cancer Navamsa which is ruled by the Moon. Magha’s liking for rituals, ancestor worship, and family pride are in the focus.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Other aspects of this Nakshatra:

</p><p>This is 10th Nakshatra of the zodiac, ruled by the node Ketu and spanning from 00°00' to 13°20' in the sign Leo (Simha), ruled by Sūrya the Sun. Ketu signifies Tapasya or relentless efforts, while Sūrya (Sun) signifies the royal charm and authority. Hence these people, in whatever capacity they work, try to achieve the highest positions through continuous efforts.
</p><p>
</p><p>Magha born are constantly trying to upgrade their skills to achieve higher levels of authority. They respect the elders and their experience. They are aware of their traditions and cultural heritage. They are straight forward, do not like to harm others and expect that others should not harm them in any way. If this does not happen, they are ready to fight and avenge the damage.
</p><p>
</p><p>Generating wealth and enjoying it at the cost of society is not in their blood. Even when they are reach, they tend to spend their money on activities that result in general welfare of the society. Because of this characteristic, these people are often failures if they undertake independent business, as reckless profit making is not in their blood. When they undertake any task, they will not leave any stone unturned till they achieve the success. They will work in the same way for others, while serving in an employee's capacity. But since they are not much interested in material wealth, an employee born in this Nakshatra will often shy away form asking for a higher salary or a higher bonus.
</p><p>
</p><p>Generally males born in this Nakshatra get a good, trustworthy wife. Females born in this Nakshatra are religious minded and most devoted to their husbands. But the females born in this Nakshatra must be cautious to avoid any frictions in the family.
