</em><br></span><br></p><p><strong>The four quarters are ruled by:</strong></p><p><em>1st Pada:</em> The first pada of the Swati Nakshatra falls in the Sagittarius Navamsa ruled by Jupiter. The focus here is on being inquisitive and overcoming your restlessness. Travel is on the cards.
</p><p><em>2nd Pada:</em> The second pada of the Swati Nakshatra falls in the Capricorn Navamsa ruled by Saturn. The pada embodies materialism. Here the native is very grounded and stable.
</p><p><em>3rd Pada:</em> The third pada of the Swati Nakshatra falls in the Aquarius Navamsa ruled by Saturn. The focus here is on creativity, knowledge and team-spirit to achieve common goals.
</p><p><em>4th Pada:</em> The fourth pada of the Swati Nakshatra falls in the Pisces Navamsa ruled by Jupiter. The native here is most flexible and swims contentedly with the tide.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Other aspects of this Nakshatra:
</strong></p><p>The Purushardha (life's vector or motivation) is Artha. 
</p><p>Totem animal is Buffalo (male). 
</p><p>Symbol - coral. 
</p><p>Devata (Deity) - Vayu. 
</p><p>Dosha - Kapha.
</p><p>
</p><p>This is 15th Nakshatra of the zodiac, having all its four quarters in Tula (Libra), spanning from 6째40' to 20째00'. The node Rahu rules this Nakshatra. The entire span of this Nakshatra falls in the sign Tula (Libra), the sign ruled by the lord of beauty, Shukra (Venus). These people have beautiful physical appearance, a well-balanced body. Females born in this sign and Nakshatra walk as if they are thinking deep before taking every step and trying to balance their body before taking any further action.
</p><p>
</p><p>A well-balanced behavior is the essence of their life. These people try to maintain a balance in every walk of their life. They believe in the principle of live and let live. Also they are helpful to others in case of their need. They do not like to do any injustice to others neither do they like any injustice being done to them. But these people are adamant, and they do not like the criticism of their work. A large number of those born in Swati earn their living trough the jobs or businesses involved in traveling.
</p><p>
</p><p>These people are intelligent and hardworking, but they have to face difficulties in the early part of their life. This is same even for the people who are born in the wealthiest families. But they early struggle serves well for these people, as they start seeing the path clearly ahead of them. The experiences learned in the early part of life serve well.
</p><p>
</p><p>A strong Shukra (Venus) or Rahu in case of those born in this Nakshatra makes the native good in art work related with the trade of cloth, jewellery, valuable stones, etc. A conjunction of moon with Shukra (Venus) will make the native extremely beautiful and lucky. These people will gain in every assignment they undertake. But in case of a beneficial aspect of Chandra (Moon) with Mangala (Mars), the native may serve in the defense forces or may earn through any of the outdoor games.
</p><p>
</p><p>When the lord of this Nakshatra, Rahu, is placed in the first house, the native will be short in height, slightly obese. When Rahu is placed in the seventh house, there will be some kind of difference in the wife and husband. For example, one of the partners may be well educated compared with the other or there will be some disparity in physical appearance.
