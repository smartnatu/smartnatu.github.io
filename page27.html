</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong><span style="font-size: 1rem;"><em>20째00" Aquarius (Kumbha) to 3째20" Pisces (Meena)&nbsp;</em></span></p><p><em>
</em></p><p><em>
</em><strong>The four quarters are ruled by: &nbsp;</strong></p><p><em>1st Pada:</em><span style="font-size: 1rem;"> The first pada of the Purva Bhadrapada Nakshatra falls in the Aries Navamsa ruled by Mars. The natives here are more mentally aggressive than physically aggressive. Here the focus of the natives will be on controlling their temper and aggression, mustering the will-power to achieve their goals.&nbsp;</span><br></p><p><em>2nd Pada:</em> The second pada of the Purva Bhadrapada Nakshatra falls in the Taurus Navamsa ruled by Venus. Here the focus is on being indulgent. The native is energetic as are prone to physically expressing the dark side of their natures.
</p><p><em>3rd Pada:</em> The third pada of the Purva Bhadrapada Nakshatra falls in the Gemini Navamsa ruled by Mercury. Here the focus is on communication, and the native is curious. Here they express the lighter aspects of their nature, such as a sense of humour.
</p><p><em>4th Pada: </em>The fourth pada of the Purva Bhadrapada Nakshatra falls in the Cancer Navamsa ruled by the Moon. Here the focus of the natives can be too dangerous, as they manifest the aspects of both the persecutor and persecuted. These natives are compatible with the natives of the other three padas.</p><p><br></p><p><strong><span style="font-size: 1rem;">Other aspects of this Nakshatra:&nbsp;</span><br><span style="font-size: 1rem;"></span></strong></p><p>The Purushartha (life's vector or motivation) is Artha. 
</p><p>Totem animal is Lion (male). 
</p><p>Symbol - a sword. 
</p><p>Devata (Deity) - Aja Ekapada. 
</p><p>Dosha - Vata.
</p><p>
</p><p>This Nakshatra spans from 20째0' in Kumbha (Aquarius) to 3째20' in Meena (Pisces). While the first three quarters of this Nakshatra fall in the sign Kumbha (Aquarius), the last Nakshatra falls in the sign Meena (Pisces). While Shani (Saturn) rules Kumbha (Aquarius), Guru (Jupiter) rules Meena (Pisces) and the Nakshatra Poorva Bhadrapada is ruled by Guru (Jupiter). Hence the outcome is the end result of a combination of all these 3 planets, depending on the quarter of the Nakshatra.
</p><p><span style="font-size: 1rem;">A person born in the first three quarters of this Nakshatra (natal sign being Kumbha (Aquarius) has a slender, tall stature. Thee natives born in the last quarter (natal sign being Meena (Pisces)) have medium height with somewhat fleshy physique. For those born in the Meena (Pisces), a well placed Guru (Jupiter) indicates good fortune, but for those who are born in the sign Kumbha (Aquarius), even a well placed Shani (Saturn), the lord of Kumbha (Aquarius) means that the person has to put in reasonable efforts to get his share of the fortune. Poorva Bhadrapada born have set principles in their life, which they like to follow under any circumstances.&nbsp;</span><br></p><p><span style="font-size: 1rem;">These people like to help others, and can render impartial advice, which helps them earn the respect and confidence of others. Making money is not the first thing in their mind and hence they may be financially weak. But what matters the most for them is the position they achieve in the society, through helping others and following their own set of principles. Also they spend money in the most proper way, avoiding any misuse of the same.&nbsp;</span><br></p><p><span style="font-size: 1rem;">Poorva Bhadrapada born tend to suffer from acidity arising out of mental tension and diabetes.&nbsp;</span><br></p><p><span style="font-size: 1rem;">Females born in this Nakshatra have a well-balanced body. They are a little more practical minded when it comes to charity.&nbsp;</span><br></p><p>
</p><p><strong>Male Natives
</strong></p><p><span style="font-size: 1rem;">1. Physical features: One of the peculiar body phenomena is that he has a lifted ankle of the foot. He is of medium size. Broad cheeks with flushy lips.&nbsp;</span><br></p><p><span style="font-size: 1rem;">2. Character and general events: He is generally a peace loving person but occasional blasting has also been noticed. He is a very simpleton type. Since he is very much principled, he has to suffer a lot mentally as he takes into his heart even a small confrontation or problem. He likes good food and is a voracious eater. He is not very particular about dresses.&nbsp;</span><br></p><p><span style="font-size: 1rem;">He normally expresses impartial opinion. He does not believe in the blind principles of religion. He is ever ready to lend a helping hand to the needy. Even so, hatred and resistance will be his reward in return. He can easily enjoy the respects and confidence of others even if he is financially weak. He is God fearing and performs religious rites in accordance with the scriptures. While the native will be moderately rich, he likes to have respect and honor from the public rather than accumulating money. He is impartial in expressing his views.&nbsp;</span><br></p><p><span style="font-size: 1rem;">3. Education, sources of earnings / profession: As he is a born intelligent and has the knack of trade he can shine in any type of job he undertakes. If he is employed in a government organization he can look forward for unexpected gains or promotions from the government. He is capable of quite independent life both socially and financially. Period between 24 and 33 years of age will mark remarkable all-round progress in his life. Even though occasional mental tension is not ruled out during this period. Period between 40 years and 54 years of age will be his golden period when he can establish fully. He keeps much restriction on the spending activities.&nbsp;</span><br></p><p><span style="font-size: 1rem;">He can shine in the field of business, banking, government job, or as a teacher, actor or writer, research worker and astrologer or astronomer. If in government service, most of the Poorva Bhadrapada born are engaged in the revenue collection department or in any capacity where cash transactions take place.&nbsp;</span><br></p><p><span style="font-size: 1rem;">4. Family life: He cannot enjoy fully the love and affection from his mother. As per the learned in astrology, the native will cause death or separation of his mother early. But in my personal experience, the native cannot derive full love and attention of his mother, as she will be working. Naturally, being a working mother, she is away most of the time and the native is automatically separated. Hence our ancients who have written this dictum are also correct to the extent of separation, but not to the extent of death. For causing death other planetary affliction is also necessary and birth in this Nakshatra alone is not sufficient.&nbsp;</span><br></p><p><span style="font-size: 1rem;">One of the redeeming features is that there will be a lot of things with which he can be proud of his father. Subject to other favorable planetary positions, father of the native has been found to have fame and possess a very good moral character. Such popularity may be mainly in the field of fine arts, oration or in the writing field. In spite of these good qualities of his father, the native quite often disagree with the opinion and confrontation takes place.&nbsp;</span><br></p><p>
5<span style="font-size: 1rem;">. Health: He is prone to paralytic attack, acidity and diabetes. He may have problems with the ribs, flanks and soles of the feet.&nbsp;</span></p><p>
</p><p><strong><span style="font-size: 1rem;">Female Natives&nbsp;</span><br></strong></p><p><span style="font-size: 1rem;">Females born in this Nakshatra will also enjoy more or less the same results as mentioned above in addition to the results mentioned below:&nbsp;</span><br></p><p>
</p><p>1. Physical features: She is neither lean nor fatty, and neither tall nor short. In some cases very slim figure have also been noticed. However, she is very beautiful in appearance.
</p><p><span style="font-size: 1rem;">2. Character and general events: Honesty and sincerity are the main characteristics of this native. She is of the type who believes that let her head is cut down, she will not deviate from the right path and principles. She is a born leader. She is capable of extracting work from others. Hence she will be successful when she gets power and authority. Example of extreme optimism.&nbsp;</span><br></p><p><span style="font-size: 1rem;">While she has the humanitarian doctrine, she will not extend her helping hand unless she is convinced fully that such kindness, sympathy and generosity are actually required. There is a peculiar politeness in her behavior.&nbsp;</span><br></p><p><span style="font-size: 1rem;">3. Education, sources of earnings / profession: Her education will be in the scientific or technical field. Hence the native is earmarked for the profession of teacher, statistician, astrologer or research worker.&nbsp;</span><br></p><p><span style="font-size: 1rem;">4. Family life: She will have more attachment towards her husband and will be blessed with children. She has good ability in the house hold administration. She will enjoy lots of benefits from her children. She will have many children if she marries a Rohini boy.&nbsp;</span><br></p><p><span style="font-size: 1rem;">5. Health: She is prone to low blood pressure, dropsy or swollen ankles, apoplexy and palpitation. Perspiring feet and enlarged liver.</span></p><p>
