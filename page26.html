</p><p><br></p><p>Shatabhishaka is the Nakshatra owned by the Northern node Rahu. The entire span of this Nakshatra falls in the sign Kumbha (Aquarius), from 6째40' to 20째00'. People born in this Nakshatra have the appearance of a well-to-do person. But they are very simple, principled people living a simple, straightforward life. They have a good memory and a tendency to remember all the bad experiences.
</p><p><span style="font-size: 1rem;">While the male born in this Nakshatra are generally abase, the females are tall and thin, with a matured expression on their face. Both male as well as female natives born in this Nakshatra are very religious and god-fearing.&nbsp;</span><br></p><p><span style="font-size: 1rem;">When the lord of the Nakshatra, Rahu, is in a fixed sign, the native tends to have an adamant nature. But this rigid attitude on the part of the native is often for some selfless cause, which has the potential to benefit the society at large. Because of their uncompromising nature when it comes to following the principles, these people have to face difficulties in their personal as well as professional lives in the early part of their life. But as the middle age dawns and they mature, they know how to have their own way without getting hurt in the process.&nbsp;</span><br></p><p><span style="font-size: 1rem;">This sign, Kumbha (Aquarius), itself is a sign indicating a research-oriented mindset. Hence a Shatabhishaka born is ideally suited for any scientific career or a research job.&nbsp;</span><br></p><p><span style="font-size: 1rem;">A badly aspected third house in the chart of the native generally indicates trouble form his/her younger brother/sister. These people have to help their relatives often. But the same generosity is seldom reciprocated. Similarly, a badly aspected 7th house and Shukra (Venus) in a Shatabhishaka born chart indicates a troubled married life.&nbsp;</span><br></p><p><span style="font-size: 1rem;">Though well to do in appearance, the health of these people is often weak. They tend to suffer from diabetics, obesity and cold.&nbsp;</span><br></p><p>
