            <div class="mbr-text col-12 col-md-8 mbr-fonts-style display-7"><p><span style="font-size: 1rem;"><strong>The 13th Nakshatra: HASTA.&nbsp;</strong></span><br></p><p><em>10째00" to 23째20" Virgo (Kanya)&nbsp;</em></p><p><em><br></em></p><p><strong>The four quarters are ruled by:&nbsp;</strong></p><p><span style="font-size: 1rem;"><em>1st Pada: </em>The first pada of the Hasta Nakshatra comes in the Aries Navamsa ruled by Mars. It signifies an excess of energy and makes the native an expert in shady activities.</span><br></p><p><em>2nd Pada: </em>The second pada of the Hasta Nakshatra falls in the Taurus Navamsa ruled by Venus. Here the focus is on practicality and material enjoyment. Natives here are more honest than natives of other padas.
</p><p><em>3rd Pada:</em> The third pada of the Hasta Nakshatra comes in the Gemini Navamsa ruled by Mercury. This pada belongs to the businessmen and professionals. Natives of this pada are very intelligent and clever.
</p><p><em>4th Pada:</em> The fourth pada of the Hasta Nakshatra comes in the Cancer Navamsa ruled by the Moon. The focus here is on harmony in the family and material security. The best and worst qualities of the natives are manifested in this pada.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Other aspects of this Nakshatra:
</strong></p><p>The Purushartha (life's vector or motivation) is Moksha. 
</p><p>Totem animal is Buffalo (female). 
</p><p>Symbol - hand's palm. 
</p><p>Devata (Deity) - Savitar. 
</p><p>Dosha - Vata.
</p><p>
</p><p>This is 13th Nakshatra of the zodiac, ruled by Chandra (Moon). Hasta spans from 10째00' to 23째20' in Kanya (Virgo). The sign Kanya (Virgo) is ruled by the planet of intelligence, Buddha (Mercury). Those born in Kanya (Virgo) are tall and thin in physical appearance. They have strong shoulders and a well-developed chest.
</p><p>
</p><p>These people have a calm and composed appearance, and will not show the slightest indication of worry even when they are under extreme tensions. But if the natal Buddha (Mercury) is in a dual sign, these people find it difficult to make some important decision and hence, start hesitating. They know how to win over the other party, hence these people can be good diplomats or are suitable for any profession that requires maintaining a liaison with various agencies/parties.
</p><p>
</p><p>Unfortunately for these people, good times quickly give way to difficult situations. Though they are hard working and sincere in their efforts, they do not get rewarded for their efforts every time. This generates a lot of heartburn. Working permanently in a subordinate position is not in their blood. Even when they begin at the lower levels, through efforts and enterprise, these people rise to higher levels in their life. Even when they do not have the formal education, they can carry out the responsibilities assigned to them through their all round knowledge and efforts.
</p><p>
</p><p>These people settle down in the middle age. With the exception of some frictions, these natives are able to enjoy a happy married life. Females born in this Nakshatra may cause friction in their house because of their love for arguments and an outspoken nature.
</p><p>
</p><p>People born in Hasta tend to suffer from sinusitis, cough, cold and asthma.
</p><p>
</p><p><strong>Male Natives
</strong></p><p><span style="font-size: 1rem;">1. Physical features: The native is tall and stout. Mixed colour with short hands comparing to the body structure. There will be a scar mark on the upper right hand or beneath the shoulder.&nbsp;</span><br></p><p>
</p><p>2. Character and general events: The native will have a calm nature. There is a peculiarity while he is smiling i.e. his sweet smile has the magnetic power to attract others. This inherent quality produces a vibration on others and it becomes difficult to leave the native once such acquaintance takes place. He can easily get respect and honor from the public. He is always in readiness to help the needy for nothing in return. He does not like to deceive others even if it costs him his life. In spite of this good quality, the reward he gets in return is nothing but criticism and opposition. He does not believe in a posh living.
</p><p>
</p><p>Unlike other Nakshatra born persons, the life of Hasta native is full of frequent ups and down. At one moment he rises to the top and another moment he falls to the bottom whether in profession al field or in the mental world. In other words, luck and unluck comes to them without intimation. Hence we cannot categorize him as a permanent poor or wealthy. When he enters in a particular field and starts gaining the object, reversal is already in store for him. While he tries to get out of such reversal with his own effort, helps comes to him from the unexpected quarters and he achieves medium success in the undertaking. It may appear that there is some hidden curse on the native as otherwise, the sincerity and hard work which he shows in every work, should have given him a wonderful boost.
</p><p>
</p><p>While the native does not want to cause any trouble to others, once he is hurt, he will always be in search of revenge, but at the same time takes consolation in the feet of god by thinking that let god give him the punishment and he slowly withdraws from the scene of conflict.
</p><p>
</p><p>3. Education, sources of earning/profession: In the work field, he keeps strict discipline. Normally employment in a subordinate level is not fit for him. Only very few cases where the Hasta native is working in a low level job has been found. Most of the cases either they are engaged in business or in a high position in the industries.
</p><p>
</p><p>Hasta native even with a preliminary academic background will possess excellent all-round knowledge. He will show to the world that he is not being anybody on any matter. He is a good adviser as he has the capacity to intervene and settle various disputed matters. Lot of responsibilities will have to be undertaken by him before he can climb one step of ladder of success.
</p><p>
</p><p>Period up to his 30th years of age will bring in unexpected circumstantial changes both in the family front as well as in the academic and professional or business field. Period between 30 to 42 years of his age will be his golden period, when the native can settle down in his life. If the native lives beyond 64 years of age, there will be remarkable accumulation of wealth and all-round success in the business field.
</p><p>
</p><p>4. Family life: He is able to enjoy an idle married life, even though occasional friction as is expected in a family will definitely be there. His wife will be a homely lady with all good qualities expected from a house wife. One of the hidden factors noticed in the wife of a Hasta native is that she may indulge in homo-sexual activities in her youth period.
</p><p>
</p><p>5. Health: He is prone to have severe cough and cold, frequent emanation of water from the nose and clotting of such fluid, asthma or cynos.
</p><p>
</p><p><strong>Female Natives
</strong></p><p><span style="font-size: 1rem;">Female natives born in Hasta Nakshatra also will enjoy more or less the same results as mentioned for a male native born in Hasta native. In addition, they will also enjoy the following results:&nbsp;</span><br></p><p>
</p><p>1. Physical features: Her eyes and ears will be extremely beautiful and entirely different from those born in other Nakshatras. A typical shoulder. Very attractive with soft body.
</p><p>
</p><p>2. Character and general events: She will have the inherent shyness of a female sex. While she will respect the elders, she may not like to live like a slave. She will not hesitate to express her views openly. She is not bothered about the outcome of such expression. Hence she is subjected to enmity from her relatives. If she curbs the tendency of open expression of her views she can attain good amount of success in the family front and enjoy her life in full.
</p><p>
</p><p>3. Education, sources of earning/profession: In most of the cases, hasta female is not employed mainly due to good financial stability of her parents as well as her husband. In some cases it has been noticed that hasta female, if born in a poor family is employed in the agricultural field and in the construction activities.
</p><p>
</p><p>4. Family life: She can enjoy a happy married life. Her husband will be wealthy and loving. She can enjoy good benefit from her children. First will be a son and followed by two daughters.
</p><p>
</p><p>5. Health: Her health will generally be good. However, she may have high blood pressure and twisting of veins, asthma in her old age.</p><p>
