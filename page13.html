</p><p>This is 11th Nakshatra of the zodiac, ruled by the planet of arts and beauty, Shukra (Venus). This Nakshatra spans from 13°20' to 26°40' in Simha (Leo). Simha is the house of the royal planet Sūrya (Sun), hence while these people have a graceful appearance; they like to behave like a king. People born in this Nakshatra have a long face and are generally handsome.
</p><p>
</p><p>Poorva Phalguni born are straight forward people. They do not like underhand dealings and given a chance, would like to prevent others form indulging in those activities. Most of these natives are religious by nature. If the lord of the Nakshatra, Shukra (Venus), is debilitated, the native will have a tendency to spend on articles of luxury. If the lord of sign, Sūrya (Sun), is debilitated, the native spends for maintaining pomp and show.
</p><p>
</p><p>These people do not like to be challenged. A challenge by their juniors will only raise the temper. Though they like authority, their independent nature often makes them difficult to enjoy the confidence of their superiors and hence, an independent profession is often the best option for them.
</p><p>
</p><p>They like to respect the elderly and knowledgeable people around them. A Poorva Phalguni born, male or female will always respect his/her parents and behave like the most obedient child. But their children are ambitious and may not like the decisions taken by their parents, i.e. the Poorva Phalguni born. This results in much family friction. But a Poorva Phalguni born gets excellent support form his/her spouse. These people eat a lot and tend to suffer from headache, sinus or high blood pressure.
