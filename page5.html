Here the focus is on generosity. Their courage may even make them want to pursue careers in the military. Planets bestow strength, stamina and will-power.
</p><p><em>2nd Pada:</em> The second pada of this Krittika Nakshatra falls in the Capricorn Navamsa ruled Saturn. Here the focus is on ethics, although it has a more material manifestation, rather than spiritual.
</p><p><em>3rd Pada:</em> The third pada of this Krittika Nakshatra falls in the Aquarius Navamsa ruled by Saturn. It is generous and compassionate. The focus here is on learning and accumulating knowledge.
</p><p><em>4th Pada: </em>The fourth pada of this Krittika Nakshatra falls in the Pisces Navamsa ruled by Jupiter. The significance of this pada is that it is extremely conscious of the material comforts, and efforts to acquire them are encouraged.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Other aspects of this Nakshatra:
</strong></p><p>The Purushartha (life's vector or motivation) is Kama. 
</p><p>Totem animal is Sheep (female). 
</p><p>Symbol - a razor. 
</p><p>Devata (Deity) - Agni. 
</p><p>Dosha - Kapha.
</p><p>
</p><p>This is the third Nakshatra of zodiac, spanning 26°40' in Mesha to 10°00' in Vrishabha. Its first quarter falls in the Mesha (Aries), while the remaining three quarters fall in Vrishabha. Accordingly, people with the moon in the first quarter show aggressive tendencies of mars, while the people with the moon in the Vrishabha are more calm and steady, showing the characteristics of the plant Venus.
</p><p>
</p><p>Generally, these people are of middle stature with a commanding appearance. They are intelligent yet a little proud. Proud side of the nature is prominent in case of natives born in Vrishabha. They are a jack of all trade but master of none. And though they can give the correct advice to people in need, they may not be able to guide themselves in times of difficulty.
</p><p>
</p><p>For these people, their self-esteem is the important thing. They are too confident of themselves and do not like to be criticized. They are generally honest and do not like to use unfair means to achieve their objectives. They have a desire to be free of any obligations, financially or morally. If the Sūrya in their chart also happens to be in a fiery sign, theses people possess excellent stamina and conviction to pursue their goals. They are not satisfied and they will not rest till they achieve what they want. While they are orthodox by nature, they do not follow the traditions blindly. They like to travel. These people tend to get legacies.
</p><p>
</p><p>These people get frustrated very easily, which leads to their provocation. And once they loose their cool, it is difficult to control them. Their behavior when provoked can be really dangerous when some explosive planet like Mars or Pluto is placed in any of the fiery signs.
</p><p>
</p><p>The urge to be free of any obligations or bonds means these people can seldom work in subordinate positions. But a government job suits them, as it carries the royal powers and authority, which is a feature of Sūrya, the lord of this Nakshatra. Their desire to work at their own speed sometimes results in others believing that they are lazy.
</p><p>
</p><p>The females born under this Nakshatra are somewhat quarrelsome. They do not hesitate to express their opinions, however opposed their views may be. This frequently results in making enemies even of close friends.
</p><p>
</p><p>The men born in this Nakshatra get a faithful spouse, good at house keeping. But they may have to live separately for some time, separation being the result of ill health of some family member. These people have a good relationship with their parents, especially the father.
</p><p>
</p><p>Lack of proper food habits results in gastric troubles, often acidity. They may suffer from dental problems, weak eyesight, piles, brain fever, accident, wounds, and meningitis.
