</p><p>This is 17th Nakshatra of the zodiac. While the planet of hardships and efforts, Shani (Saturn), rules this Nakshatra, the fiery and aggressive planet, Mangala (Mars), rules the sign. Mangala (Mars) and Shani (Saturn) are mutual enemies, having some of the most different characteristics. Thus, people born in this Nakshatra also show some very peculiar characteristics.
</p><p><span style="font-size: 1rem;">Anuradha born children are somewhat weak in the beginning, but become stronger as they grow up. These people have a good height, lean and yet strong physique. As a rule, Anuradha born have to face several obstacles in their life, and hence they have a somewhat defeated look on their face. They are fairly straight forward, but if they get a feeling that some one is unnecessarily creating obstacles in their path, then Anuradha born are likely to harbor a feeling to take the revenge. These people are ready to wait long for the opportune moment to take the final action.&nbsp;</span><br></p><p><span style="font-size: 1rem;">While Mangala (Mars) gives them the soldierly abilities to march forward and achieve the objectives at any cost, the planet of efforts, Shani (Saturn), enables them to keep on trying again and again till they reach their destination. These people have an independent nature and will do anything to preserve their independence. This fiercely independent nature also makes them start earning at a very young age. But the lord of Nakshatra, Shani (Saturn), makes them struggle at every step till the second half of their life, after which, they enjoy a smooth sailing.&nbsp;</span><br></p><p><span style="font-size: 1rem;">Anuradha born, are not on good terms with their parents and other close relations. Seldom anyone from these relations becomes helpful for their progress in life. On the other hand, their spouse gives them the all round support necessary to make their marriage a success.&nbsp;</span><br></p><p>
