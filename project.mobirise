The planets are regarded as basic life-forces, the tools we live by as well as the basis of our very substance. These planetary forces take on different forms, depending on their zodiacal position and on the way they relate to one another. &nbsp;The aspects formed between the planets describe these relationships, the positions of the planets in relation to the place of birth tell us of their expression in the spheres of life depicted by the astrological houses. &nbsp;The nakshatras are the apparently fixed bodies in the Zodiac, where the planetary system moves with them placed in the background. Among the Rasi and the nakshatras, the former is overlorded by the Sun, whereas the latter is overlorded by Moon. This implies that the Rasi shows the environment we would be placed with at different times in our life and what we get out of it, on the other hand, the nakshatras govern the different state of mind we shall be having at various times. Even the actual events are important in our life, taking a person-centric view point; our reactions to them also matter equally.</p>\n                <div mbr-buttons mbr-theme-style=\"display-4\" class=\"mbr-section-btn\" mbr-if=\"showButtons\" data-toolbar=\"-mbrBtnMove\"><a class=\"btn btn-md btn-secondary\" href=\"page1.html\" data-app-placeholder=\"Type Text\">NAKSHATRA</a>\n                    <a class=\"btn btn-md btn-white-outline\" href=\"page2.html\" data-app-placeholder=\"Type Text\">RASI&nbsp;</a></div>\n            </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n    <div mbr-if=\"showArrow\" class=\"mbr-arrow hidden-sm-down\" aria-hidden=\"true\">\n        <a href=\"#next\">\n            <i class=\"mbri-down mbr-iconfont\"></i>\n        </a>\n    </div>\n</section>",

Entire Ashwini Nakshatra falls in the Mesha (Aries), which is ruled by the aggressive and fiery planet Mars (Mangala). Though generally the qualities like aggressiveness are prominent in natives born in this sign (Rashi) and Nakshatra, the occurrence of the same may differ according to the quarter occupied by the Chandra (Moon) and the sign occupied by the lord of the Nakshatra, Ketu.\n</div><div>\n</div><div><br></div><div>Males born in this Nakshatra have large eyes and a broad forehead. The nose is slightly bigger and longer compared to the rest of the face. Generally these people are slim but yet powerful. If any of the fiery planets, viz. The Sūrya (Sun) or Mangala (Mars) is placed in any of the fiery signs, viz. Mesha (Aries), Simha (Leo) or Dhanu (Sagittarius), these people have good disease resistant power.\n</div><div>\n</div><div><br></div><div>People born in Ashwini are generally cheerful, nearly always bubbling with enthusiasm. They are very active, always busy doing something and if nothing else, will spend their time keeping their house neat and clean.\n</div><div>\n</div><div>They are faithful to the people who love them and will try to do anything for such people to reciprocate their love. But understanding somewhat rude and strange behavior of Ashwini natives will be the responsibility of others. If the others can do this, then Ashwini native will prove to be the best friend one can find. Ashwini natives are sympathetic to the people in trouble and can provide proper guidance to such people.\n</div><div>\n</div><div><br></div><div>Though aggressive and rude in normal times, males and females born in this Nakshatra know how to keep their patience in times of difficulty. For this reason, males born in this Nakshatra make some of the best military officers. But it is very difficult to calm these people when they loose their cool.\n</div><div>\n</div><div><br></div><div>These people are stubborn and whenever provoked, will try to avenge their insult. This quality is most prominent in case of people having strong Mars (Mangala). If Ketu, lord of Ashwini is occupying Vrshchika, such person will have the tendency to take revenge secretly.\n</div><div>\n</div><div>They meticulously plan their tasks and consider nearly every aspect of the issue before taking any action. They are ready to accept the responsibility of their actions, whether good or bad.\n</div><div>\n</div><div><br></div><div>A male born in this Nakshatra is a firm believer in God and respects holy places. But he also carries the view that religion is not an end in itself; rather, it is a tool for humankind to achieve happiness. Hence, he also believes that a religion needs to keep on adapting to modern times. A female born under this Nakshatra tries to stick to old traditions while carrying a modern mindset. She likes to respect the old and elderly and perform the traditional family rituals.\n</div><div>\n</div><div>Ashwini natives are a jack of all trades. In their quest to know as many new things as possible, they end up trying various vocations, rarely carrying on a single vocation for a longer period. </div><div><br></div><div>Generally they have to struggle for success even in small matters till the 30th year.\n</div><div>\n</div><div>The wise old saying 'Marry in haste and repent at leisure' fits perfectly to these people. Though they sincerely love their family members and close associates, their somewhat rude behavior sometimes alienates them. When that happens, these people feel rejected. Many times they receive help and appreciation from people outside their family.\n</div><div>\n</div><div><b><br></b></div><div><b>Male Natives\n</b></div><div>\n</div><div>1.

There is a saying that even Yama, the God of Death, cannot change his adamant attitude. Those born in the Ashwini of other months will have stubbornness in a lesser degree.\n</div><div>\n</div><div>He will remain faithful to those who love him and will not hesitate to sacrifice anything for such persons. Ashwini born is the best friend in need provided others understand him. He keeps his patience even at the time of greatest perils. But it will be a hurricane task to console the native when he goes berserk. He is the best adviser to the persons in agony. But he deeply resents and fears criticism, see suggestions from others, as a frightening attempt at manipulation.\n</div><div>\n</div><div>He takes his own time to do any work. Even so, his actions may be slow but well thought. He will not jump upon any matter without examining prose and corns of each item of work. He cannot be easily influenced.

He is inclined to meet his desires and needs at any cost.\n</div><div>\n</div><div><br></div><div>4. Family life : He loves his family in entire sincerity. However, he is subjected to hatred by his own family members due to his adamant behavior. Affection that was expected and the care that was required, cannot be derived from the father of the native. In other words, the natives as also his co-borns will be neglected by their father. Whatever help he may derive is only from the side of his maternal uncle. Maximum possible help will come from those who are outside the family circle.\n</div><div>\n</div><div><br></div><div>Normally marriage takes place between 26 to 30 years of age.

It is not a negative point. She may do so, as her financial or other conditions would have improved by her 50th years of age, and she no longer requires any work for her livelihood.

Administrative type of job is earmarked for her.\n</div><div>\n</div><div><br></div><div>4.Family life: Normally marriage takes place between the period of 23 years to 26 years of age. It has been noticed that in case marriage takes place at a young age i.e., before the age of 23 years, such marriage ends either at divorce, separation from the husband for long time or even death of the husband.\n</div><div>\n</div><div><br></div><div>There will be more female children than male children.

The planet of art and beauty, Shukra (Venus), rules this Nakshatra. People born in this Nakshatra are generally harmless creatures. This is in stark contrast to Ashwini and Krittika natives, who are aggressive to the core. Bharani born are honest.

Arts, entertainment and ways and means of enjoying material pleasure give them their fixed stream of income. Surgery, especially plastic surgery is also a good career option.\n</div><div>\n</div><div><br></div><div>These people are normally happy in their marital relations. Their life partners take good care of household duties. These people love their families and do not like to live away from their families. These people are prone to suffer from diabetes and teeth problems.\n</div><div>\n</div><div>Females born in this Nakshatra are career minded. But they are seldom found occupying senior positions.

Here the focus is on generosity. Their courage may even make them want to pursue careers in the military. Planets bestow strength, stamina and will-power.\n</p><p><i>2nd Pada:</i> The second pada of this Krittika Nakshatra falls in the Capricorn Navamsa ruled Saturn. Here the focus is on ethics, although it has a more material manifestation, rather than spiritual.\n</p><p><i>3rd Pada:</i> The third pada of this Krittika Nakshatra falls in the Aquarius Navamsa ruled by Saturn. It is generous and compassionate. The focus here is on learning and accumulating knowledge.\n</p><p><i>4th Pada: </i>The fourth pada of this Krittika Nakshatra falls in the Pisces Navamsa ruled by Jupiter. The significance of this pada is that it is extremely conscious of the material comforts, and efforts to acquire them are encouraged.</p><p><br></p><p><b>Other aspects of this Nakshatra:\n</b></p><p>The Purushartha (life's vector or motivation) is Kama. \n</p><p>Totem animal is Sheep (female). \n</p><p>Symbol - a razor. \n</p><p>Devata (Deity) - Agni. \n</p><p>Dosha - Kapha.\n</p><p>\n</p><p>This is the third Nakshatra of zodiac, spanning 26°40' in Mesha to 10°00' in Vrishabha. Its first quarter falls in the Mesha (Aries), while the remaining three quarters fall in Vrishabha. Accordingly, people with the moon in the first quarter show aggressive tendencies of mars, while the people with the moon in the Vrishabha are more calm and steady, showing the characteristics of the plant Venus.\n</p><p>\n</p><p>Generally, these people are of middle stature with a commanding appearance. They are intelligent yet a little proud. Proud side of the nature is prominent in case of natives born in Vrishabha. They are a jack of all trade but master of none. And though they can give the correct advice to people in need, they may not be able to guide themselves in times of difficulty.\n</p><p>\n</p><p>For these people, their self-esteem is the important thing. They are too confident of themselves and do not like to be criticized. They are generally honest and do not like to use unfair means to achieve their objectives. They have a desire to be free of any obligations, financially or morally. If the Sūrya in their chart also happens to be in a fiery sign, theses people possess excellent stamina and conviction to pursue their goals. They are not satisfied and they will not rest till they achieve what they want. While they are orthodox by nature, they do not follow the traditions blindly. They like to travel. These people tend to get legacies.\n</p><p>\n</p><p>These people get frustrated very easily, which leads to their provocation. And once they loose their cool, it is difficult to control them. Their behavior when provoked can be really dangerous when some explosive planet like Mars or Pluto is placed in any of the fiery signs.\n</p><p>\n</p><p>The urge to be free of any obligations or bonds means these people can seldom work in subordinate positions. But a government job suits them, as it carries the royal powers and authority, which is a feature of Sūrya, the lord of this Nakshatra. Their desire to work at their own speed sometimes results in others believing that they are lazy.\n</p><p>\n</p><p>The females born under this Nakshatra are somewhat quarrelsome. They do not hesitate to express their opinions, however opposed their views may be. This frequently results in making enemies even of close friends.\n</p><p>\n</p><p>The men born in this Nakshatra get a faithful spouse, good at house keeping. But they may have to live separately for some time, separation being the result of ill health of some family member. These people have a good relationship with their parents, especially the father.\n</p><p>\n</p><p>Lack of proper food habits results in gastric troubles, often acidity. They may suffer from dental problems, weak eyesight, piles, brain fever, accident, wounds, and meningitis.\n</p><p>\n</p><p><b>Male Natives\n</b></p><p>\n</p><p>1. Physical features: Normally he is of middle stature. However, native with Saturn's aspect to this segment has a tall body. His nose is prominent and his eyes sympathetic, neck thick and stout, solidly built body with big shoulders and well developed muscles, countenance peaceful and his behavior respectful. He has a commanding appearance.\n</p><p>\n</p><p>2. Character and general events: While he is on the one hand very intelligent, on the other hand he cannot pursues any goal for long. In other words he easily gets bored with any particular thing and jump upon another without knowing the pros and cons. He is capable of rendering good advice and tells others the way out for any problem. But in his own life, he does what he thinks at a particular time.\n</p><p>\n</p><p>He will discard any friendship if that friendship questions his ego and freedom. But at the same time he does not like to achieve name, fame and wealth through unfair means or at the mercy of others. His needs or wants are not beyond reason nor his accumulations always spectacular, although his money making abilities are often phenomenal, his motivation however derives from an emphatic wish to remain free from obligations. He cannot find fault in his own action. Optimism followed with self-pride is one of the characteristics of these persons. He is determined to go ahead with great energy and shows his stubborn and tenacious nature.\n</p><p>\n</p><p>Orthodoxy and monotheism are combined in him i.e. while he is orthodox he does not believe in age-old blind belief and customs. Persistent effort and hard work are his motto. He is eager to render some positive service to the world but he cannot shine for longer period. He involves himself in public life sincerely but loss and failures are ultimate gain. This drawback is attributable to lack of ability to move according to the situation.\n</p><p>\n</p><p>He tries to impose certain restriction and control through self-assessment and modify them according to his sweet will. Once a promise is made, it will be carried out at any cost.\n</p><p>\n</p><p>In the public life he can attain name, fame and respect. Excess of sincerity will be the means of his downfall. Frustrations start hunting him even on small matters and lead him to outburst. Once he got heated up, subsequent steps will be dangerous. Hence he has to observe maximum mental balance and keep away the out bursting temperament. Remarkable ability will be shown in arguments and counter arguments with reasoning. It is quite often seen that these types of persons will be bereft of truth and money, undertakes unnecessary travel. They are thankless and will utter cruel words.\n</p><p>\n</p><p>3. Education, source of earning/profession: Mostly Krttika born will not stay in the hometown. That means his livelihood will be in the foreign land. When I say foreign, it is not necessary that it should be a foreign country. Foreign land means a little away from the place where he is born. Partnership business is not suitable to him.\n</p><p>\n</p><p>He derives benefits from the government. Engineer, doctor specialized in venereal diseases, treasury department, draftsman. In case the native is interested in business he can derive maximum benefits from the yarn export, medicines and decorative industries. A large legacy at any part of his life is awaiting for him. He is very slow in any work. Hence for success in life, he is advised to increase the speed while doing any work as otherwise he may be dragged behind others.\n</p><p>\n</p><p>4. Family life: He is generally lucky in his married life. His spouse will be expert in household administration, dedicated and devoted, faithful and virtuous. With all these plus points, health of the spouse will be a concern for him and / or circumstances may so be created that he has to quite often live separately. When I say separation, it may be due to work or due to ill health to either of the family members i.e. parents of the spouse etc. and not due to disharmony between the couple.\n</p><p>\n</p><p>While he has to confront with many obstacles in various walks of life, he will be contended and lucky in the family field, where he enjoys the utmost satisfaction and peace.\n</p><p>\n</p><p>He is more attached to mother. Among his co-borns, the native will enjoy more favor and love from the mother. While his father will be a pious man and well-known person, the native cannot enjoy comforts and benefits from father. His life up to 50 years of age will be full of trial and have to face frequent changes in surroundings. However, period between 25 years and 35 years and 50 years and 56 years will be very good.\n</p><p>\n</p><p>Love marriage is indicated to the native. Sometimes, it has been found that Krttika born marries a girl known to his family.\n</p><p>\n</p><p>5. Health: He has good appetite but he cannot has a systematic food habit. Diseases to which he is prone to are dental problem, weak eyesight, tuberculosis, wind and piles, brain fever, accident, wounds, malaria or cerebral meningitis.\n</p><p>\n</p><p>Whatever may be the condition of his health, whether good or bad, neither he is afraid of any disease nor he is ready to observe daily care of his health.\n</p><p>\n</p><p><b>Female Natives\n</b></p><p>\n</p><p>1. Physical Features: she will have a clean body, medium height and extremely beautiful up to her 27th years of age. Thereafter, due to sudden psychological or circumstantial changes, her beauty slowly starts fading.\n</p><p>\n</p><p>2. Character and general events: while she is not completely loveless, she will not subdue to the pressure of others. Therefore, mentally she has to suffer. She is fond of quarrels. She expresses arrogance not only in her appearance but also in the domestic environment.\n</p><p>\n</p><p>3. Education, sources of income/profession: normally only a very few percentage of Krttika females are highly educated. She earns by working in the paddy field, agriculture field, fisheries and other small-scale industries. When the birth is in the 1st degree of Krttika or 12 to 13.20 degree of Krttika, the native becomes highly learned and she may be an Administrative Office, doctor or chemical engineer or a teacher. She also earns as a musician or artist, tailor or from leather products.\n</p><p>\n</p><p>4. Family life: she cannot enjoy full comforts of her husband. In some cases childlessness or separation from husband is also indicated and in few cases no marriage takes place. In case marriage does not takes place in early age, in several cases it has been that her 37th year is good for marriage. She will not keep cordial relation with relatives as a sense of suppression and subordination is rampant in mind. Truth is that these females live in an illusion world and they show discourtesy to the people who actually are their well wishes. Ultimately a secluded life is in store for them.\n</p><p>\n</p><p>5. Health: health will be severely afflicted either due to excess work or lack of mental peace. Glandular tuberculosis has also been noticed</p></div>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n</section>",

It spreads from 10°00' in Vrishabha to 23°20' in Vrishabha. Chandra (Moon), the lord of this Nakshatra and Shukra (Venus), the lord of Vrishabha, though belong to the opposite camps of planets, they complement many of each other's qualities for a person born in this Nakshatra. As a result, while Shukra (Venus) makes these people beautiful with an artistic mind, the Chandra (Moon) endows them with gentle, dignified manners. Vrishabha also happens to be the exalted sign of Chandra (Moon). It is said that even a beggar born on this Nakshatra will have a dignified appearance. Eyes of the people born in this Nakshatra are especially attractive.\n</p><p>\n</p><p>These people are obstinate by nature and attempts by others to ignore their views only results in worsening the situation. They seem to be hell bent to have their own say in every matter. While they are quick to point at others faults, they seldom accept their own faults. Emotions rule supreme in these people. These people will have to control their stubborn nature if they want to work in groups or be in professions that require dealing with people. Keeping a flexible mindset will always help them.\n</p><p>\n</p><p>A Shukra (Venus) placed in a movable sign will make the native spendthrift to enjoy material comforts. Females born in this Nakshatra tend to display whatever riches they have.\n</p><p>\n</p><p>These people are ideally suited for any kind of artistic work and the jobs or businesses dealing with juicy and sweet materials. But these people should exercise extra caution while dealing with their business partners.\n</p><p>\n</p><p>They are attached to the mother's side of family tree. Since the Chandra (Moon) rules the mind, living a tension free life is important for them. These people are prone to suffer from hormonal imbalances caused by mental worries.\n</p><p>\n</p><p><b>Male Natives\n</b></p><p>\n</p><p>1. Physical Features: He is normally of slim physique. However, based on other planetary positions and aspects, short structured and fatty persons have also been seen. His eyes are very attractive with a special magnetic touch.

Once he gets angry, it will not subside so easily, and nobody can change his decision. He becomes extremely obstinate if some one attempts to over-ride his opinions or thwart his plans. He remains oblivious to any advice or ideas counter to his own.\n</p><p>\n</p><p>He has special knack to find faults of others. Whereas, he cannot work with a fixed aim. He is ruled by his heart rather than his brain. While he is ready to sacrifice everything for his loved ones, he will not hesitate to cause extreme trouble to the hated. He feels impressed upon his own work.\n</p><p>\n</p><p>Acceptance of the truth and discard of the false is his plus point. His life is full of ups and downs as he does not try to pre-plan his objectives. He can attain great success in his life provided a little restraint is kept in the freedom of his mind. There is no tomorrow for him. He spends everything for today's comfort.\n</p><p>\n</p><p>3. Education, sources of earning / profession: As far as possible he tries to be more sincere and honest in all the work he undertakes. But he lacks patience and forgiveness. He tries to be jack off all arts and in the process he fails to pass through the path of requisite rhythm and system.\n</p><p>\n</p><p>His freedom of mind will quite often lead him to the downfall. It is also seen that some Rohini born persons have risen from the lowest rung of life due to the finest placements of other planets.\n</p><p>\n</p><p>He may earn from milk products, sugarcane or as a chemical engineer. He is best adapted for mechanical or laborious work.\n</p><p>\n</p><p>Periods between the age of 18 years and 36 years will be the most trial some periods. He will have to face a lot of problems economically, socially and on health grounds. It is often noticed that such people enjoy their life's best between the age of 38 years and 50 years and 65 years and 75 years of age. One of the primary factors to be born in mind is that he should never take anybody into confidence.. He has to be extra careful in his business partners and employees. There is an inherent drawback in him that he blindly believe others. For a happy existence, it is suggested that he should screen the persons thoroughly before confidence is bestowed on such persons.\n</p><p>\n</p><p>4. Family life: While he cannot enjoy full benefit from his father, he will be more attached to his mother and maternal uncle or maternal things. He will not hesitate to throw away any social or religious laws when warranted for. Hence his married life will be marred with disturbances.\n</p><p>\n</p><p>5.

But a general picture of these natives is given below.\n</p><p>\n</p><p>People born in this Nakshatra have a strong body and moderate complexion. Those born in the Vrishabha will have a fair complexion compared to those born in the Mithuna.\n</p><p>\n</p><p>They are sincere in their behavior towards others and expect that others should also behave in the same way. But this seldom happens. As a result, there are chances that this native may get cheated very often, especially from the people close to him. When this happens, these people find it difficult to come to term with the situation. They do not like being manipulated or cheated by others. When this happens, they may harbor a tendency to take revenge.\n</p><p>\n</p><p>They are peace loving by nature, but provoking them will be dangerous. They have a good grasping power, can quickly learn new things and have a creative nature.\n</p><p>\n</p><p>These people are honest, straightforward and contrary to most of the people born in Vrishabha, tend to live a simple life. But they find it difficult to make up their mind on important decisions, as a result of which they have to go the trial and error way. This is why they take more time to settle down in life.\n</p><p>\n</p><p>Females born in this Nakshatra like to control their husbands. They try to keep themselves busy in some way after the marriage and like to have an upper hand in the domestic affairs.\n</p><p>\n</p><p>These people get good education. For those born with their moon in Mithuna, a career in accountancy is a good option. For those born in the Vrishabha, their good business sense is often proved useful in complementing their education. But they have to try many lines of profession before they settle down in a particular field.\n</p><p>\n</p><p>These people are misunderstood many times by those whom they love. Their partners have health troubles and there is also some tension in marital relations. When it comes to health, these natives are prone to suffer form acidity and constipation.\n</p><p>\n</p><p><b><br></b></p><p><b>Male Natives\n</b></p><p>\n</p><p>1. Physical feature: He will have a beautiful and stout body, tall, moderate complexion, thin legs and long arms.\n</p><p>\n</p><p>2. Character and general events: There is a peculiar tendency seen in him. He has a doubting nature. He is always suspicious of everything. He is very sincere in his dealings with others and he expects the same reciprocal sincerity nature others find it pleasant to deal with him. But a word of precaution is necessary here that he has to be very careful while dealing with his friends and relatives as also in any partnership business as he may be cheated. Blind trust put on others will quite often lead him into later frustration and repentance.\n</p><p>\n</p><p>He has a knack to deal with even those who ditch him. He has a natural initiative, awareness, brilliancy of mind, eagerness and active agility, but as a result of his affectionate regard for others, he is buffeted by both circumstances and people.\n</p><p>\n</p><p>He is very simpleton. He prefers a life of simplicity and principled. He always expresses impartial and sincere opinion. He can be impatient to the point of intolerance when confronted with prejudice , judgment or action by others. While he expresses to others opinion, it is never brought into his life. He acts according to his own sweet will. Outwardly expresses to the public that it is very courageous and will not hesitate to do anything which requires extreme courage, whereas he is an inborn coward.\n</p><p>\n</p><p>He will not have peace of mind and get irritated even on small matters. His life up to 32 years of age will be full of trials and errors and would appear to be like a lost boat in the center of the ocean i.e., the question of where to go, how to go and why to go will permanently rampage his mind without any conclusion. His 32nd age onwards, life will start settling down down to the maximum satisfaction provided other planetary positions are good.\n</p><p>\n</p><p>3. Education, sources of earning / profession : He will have good education. He is a very good financial adviser. He advises others to curb the spending but he cannot control the expenditure and at last finds himself in the extreme economic conflict. He achieves success in life, including business if engaged after the age of 32 years. Till that time he has to face several ups and downs. He often begins projects rather than finishing the tediously routine tasks of the one in hand. It is mainly due to percipience rather than weakness and above all his ability to understand the possibility of success or no success of a project in hand, discard it immediately and replaces it immediately and replaces it with another which is more viable. In other words, he cannot undertake any permanent or continuing nature of work.\n</p><p>\n</p><p>Period between 33 years and 50 years will be a period of full of strength and activities followed by utmost satisfaction. During this period he can achieve the benefits unexpectedly. But whatever he will be earning during this period will be wasted later on due to his own fault.\n</p><p>\n</p><p>4. Family life : No benefit will be derived from the co-borns. Co-borns will not only cause troubles and problems to the native, but also maintain extreme enmity so as to harm the native. His sincere love and affection will not have any any effect in his relatives. In other words, the native is mistaken absolutely for no fault of his own. That is why we are bound to believe the existence of God and the relationship of stars over the human beings.\n</p><p>\n</p><p>His spouse may not keep good health. Moreover, his married life is not cordial, mainly due to difference of opinion on silly matters, and the adamant nature of the native. In some cases, it is seen that the reason for the disharmony between the couple is mainly due to the better occupation in life by one of them, and the consequent inferiority complex.\n</p><p>\n</p><p>5. Health : He has to face ill-health during his childhood. Frequent constipation ultimately leading to stomach disorder, cuts and injuries, pains in the shoulders near collarbones.\n</p><p>\n</p><p><b><br></b></p><p><b>Female Natives\n</b></p><p>\n</p><p>Female natives born in this Nakshatra will also enjoy more or less the same results as mentioned above in the case of male natives. In addition they will enjoy the following results:\n</p><p>\n</p><p>1. Physical features : She is tall, sharp look, lean body. Her countenance and body are very beautiful.\n</p><p>\n</p><p>2. Character and general events : She is very intelligent. She takes keen interest in the social work. Mentally always alert, quick-witted, selfish. Since she has a poisonous tongue, she has to be careful when entering to arguments or getting angry as in case she curses others, such curse has the power to harm others. She is educated, fond of fine arts. She will have children and devotes to her husband. Acquires considerable wealth. Enjoys good food. She will be lucky to have ornaments and fine clothing. She is greedy for wealth.\n</p><p>\n</p><p>3. Education, sources of earnings / profession : Attains good knowledge in the mechanical or electrical engineering, telephones, electronics etc. It may become surprising that being a female native, how she is more interested in the jobs that are normally done by males.\n</p><p>\n</p><p>4. Family life : Even after marriage, she keeps busy in various activities. She keeps her husband under her control. There may be one or two love affairs early in her life, which has not culminated into marriage. However, after marriage she is very much attached to her husband, as if nothing has taken place in the past.\n</p><p>\n</p><p>5. Health : Intermittent health problems will take place.

During this phase there is curiosity and the desire to explore. Planets in this pada are relaxed, but may be prone to material excesses. It is the calm before the storm and things do not look too rosy.\n</p><p><i>2nd Pada: </i>The second quarter of this Nakshatra falls in the Capricorn Navamsa, ruled by Saturn. It signifies all kinds of material ambitions and frustrations. The negative qualities of this Nakshatra generally surface during this quarter. The storm has intensified here; therefore planets bring misfortune and problems.<i>\n</i></p><p><i>3rd Pada: </i>The third pada of the Ardra Nakshatra falls in the Aquarius Navamsa, ruled by Saturn.

Negative traits such as intolerance and too much dependence on others are also manifested here.</div><div><br></div><div><b>Other aspects of this Nakshatra:\n</b></div><div>The Purushardha (life's vector or motivation) is Dharma. \n</div><div>Totem animal is Sheep (male). \n</div><div>Symbol - a flower, circle or an arrow. \n</div><div>Devata (Deity) - Brihaspati. \n</div><div>Dosha - Pitta.\n</div><div>\n</div><div>This is the 8th Nakshatra in zodiac, spanning from 3°20' to 16°40' in Karkata. This entire Nakshatra falls in the sign Karkata, ruled by the watery planet Chandra (Moon) while the barren planet, Shani (Saturn), rules this Nakshatra itself. Hence, these people possess some of the very opposite characteristics. While males born in this sign are likely to be tall but thin, females born in this sign are short in stature with an oval face.\n</div><div>\n</div><div>Pushya born are faint-hearted and they do not want to alienate others through their decisions. A government or police officer born on this Nakshatra will mess up his responsibilities. But a contrary may be proved in case of natives born with strong Mangala (Mars) or Sūrya (Sun) in their natal charts. These people respect laws and believe that nobody should be above the law. A Pushya born likes flattery and he is averse to negative remarks by others.\n</div><div>\n</div><div>The word Pushya means to strengthen, to fortify. Hence though the people born on this Nakshatra have to face hardships in the early part of their life, they start achieving success from their mid-twenties. Excessive dependence on others in the early part of their life teaches them the importance of being self-reliant. Hence they tend to be independent of others in the latter part of their life. They go on learning with age and experience, often nullifying the need of formal education. As far as possible, they should get enrolled for a course in arts or commerce.\n</div><div>\n</div><div>Pushya natives should understand their strengths and weaknesses before taking up vocations or embarking on business ventures. A proper match of their qualities with the requirements of their job or profession will give good results in their career advancement. But they are also restless workers, an inherent quality of Saturn, as a result of which they do not give up easily when met with failures. But while working for others, these people need to show restrain and confine their enthusiasm to the boundaries defined by their superiors. Otherwise, the end results will be far different from what was actually expected.\n</div><div>\n</div><div>Pushya born like to live with their family, but the circumstances are often such that they have to live in far off places to earn a living. Hardships experienced by them result in these people expecting their marriage partners to be self-reliant as well.\n</div><div>\n</div><div>These people are likely to suffer from lack of hormones that help in body growth and digestion, skin troubles, cough and cold and asthma. They will not keep good health in the early part of their life, up-to the age of 20 years.\n</div><div>\n</div><div><b>Male Natives\n</b></div><div>\n</div><div>1. Physical Features: It is very difficult to define or describe the body structure or the look of Pushya born native, as there is no specific structure exclusively enjoyed by Pushya born. In other words, varying sizes are noticed. One rare sign, as a mark of identification noticed in these persons, is that there will be a distinguished mark, may be a scar or a black mole on their face.\n</div><div>\n</div><div>2. Character and general events: He is very weak at heart. He finds it difficult to reach at conclusion on any matter. He will have good knack of behavior but that behavior is only for the sake of selfish interest. This clearly indicates that his outward expression is hypocritical and against his consciousness i.e. the inner expression is negative and the outward expression is positive. Respecting others is unknown to him whereas expectation of respect is within him. He responds quickly to admiration and become quickly deflated by criticism, giving himself to love and affection with sincerity and appreciation, yet he is ever mindful of slights and he hesitate to form strong attachments.\n</div><div>\n</div><div>As already explained above, the inherent freedom available in all walks of life will lead to him to the bad company. Hence he has to be very careful with his friends. He is fond of good dresses.\n</div><div>\n</div><div>3. Education, sources of earning/profession: He will jump upon any work without judging or thinking whether he is capable of doing such work or not, and ultimately push him into utter failure in any work he undertakes. While I say that he is not a good anticipator, he is very good in certain work and sweet words are just a natural expression for him. It would be better if he assess his capacity and ability for the specific field where he can shine well and then start doing the job. If that is done, nobody on earth can stop him in achieving the requisite result. One of the plus points for him is that he is not easily vulnerable to defeat and he pushes his way up through several obstacles.\n</div><div>\n</div><div>Even if he does not have any basic education, he will show extra-ordinary intelligence and knowledge on any matter of discussion. Another plus point for him is that he will resist tooth and nail any idea or program or work which is not within the spirit of law. He is of the opinion that all wrong doers must be punished whether they are his friends or relatives or enemies. He will carry out any work entrusted to him with utmost sincerely and certainty. While he wants to complete the work which he commences or assigned to him in perfect condition, the outcome in most of the cases i.e negative because of his too much independent nature. His abilities are many faceted but his success is as probable in the theater or the arts of in commerce.\n</div><div>\n</div><div>In most cases it is seen that Pushy born will have to face the grip of poverty up to the age of 15-16 years of age and thereafter he will enjoy a mixture of good and bad, where plus will be less and minus will be more up to the age of 32 years. From the age of 33 years, there will be remarkable all round improvements i.e. economically, socially and in health.\n</div><div>\n</div><div>In most cases it has been seen that Pushya born will stay away from his native place and family for his bread earning. He normally undertakes the work where maximum traveling is involved.\n</div><div>\n</div><div>4. Family life: There will be lot of problems in the family circle and he will have to depend on others for even day to day requirements. Due to this dependency during childhood he becomes quite independent when he grows up.\n</div><div>\n</div><div>Circumstances will be so warranted that he will be forced to stay away most of the time from his wife and children even though he is very much wanting to be attached with them. He expects his wife to be thoroughly self sufficient, with creditable talents and to be correct and conservative in manner and dress. If the marriage of the native is performed without proper comparison or tallying of the horoscope, he may lose all rational perspective and begin to doubt his wife rather than admitting his own lack of discernment. He is very much attached to his parents.\n</div><div>\n</div><div>5. Health: He will not keep good health during his childhood i.e. up to the age of 15 years. Gall stones, gastric ulcer, jaundice, cough, eczema and cancer are the possible diseases.\n</div><div>\n</div><div><b>Female Natives:\n</b></div><div>\n</div><div>1. Physical Features: She has a short stature, moderate complexion, well-proportioned face and body. Generally pretty.\n</div><div>\n</div><div>2. Character and general events: She will not enjoy peaceful existence. She has a very amicable character and is peace-minded, very submissive to the elders but oppressed by all. She is sincere, affectionate but moody. She is religious and god fearing. Respects her elders. She is conservative. Does systematical and methodical action.\n</div><div>\n</div><div>3. Education, sources of earning/profession: She may have income from land and buildings. She may be employed in a job where maximum trust is required e.g. Private Secretaries, Secret departments of a country. She may also have income from agriculture.\n</div><div>\n</div><div>4. Family Life: Even though she is 'Pativrata' (attached to won husband only) she is quite often mistaken by her husband for her moral character. This situation can be avoided if she keeps a little control and restriction over her husband by shedding away her shyness and her outward expression is made clear to her husband and others. Reasons for most of the turmoil in her life is mainly attributable to what she thinks inside and what she expresses outside. She wants to say a lot of things but she is prevented by her inherent quality of shyness, which often misleads others, and a negative opinion is formed about the native. She will have good duty bound children.\n</div><div>\n</div><div>5. Health: She will have respiratory problem. She is prone to tuberculosis, ulcers, breast cancer, and jaundice, eczema, bruises in the breast or gastric ulcer.</div><p></p></div>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n</section>",

While the planet of intelligence, Buddha (Mercury), rules this Nakshatra, the lord of the sign is Chandra (Moon). As a result, these people retain the charm of young age even in their old age.\n</span></div><div><span style=\"font-size: 1rem;\">\n</span></div><div><span style=\"font-size: 1rem;\">Ashlesha born have a stout body and somewhat ruddy complexion. But their disease resistant capacity is limited. They tend to put on weight in the middle age. Unless they have a strong Mangala (Mars) placed favorably in their chart, they will lack aggressiveness. Females born in this Nakshatra know how to win their opponents through tact. But contrary to the males born in this sign, these females are somewhat shy, reluctant to come out with their views openly.\n</span></div><div><span style=\"font-size: 1rem;\">\n</span></div><div><span style=\"font-size: 1rem;\">Ashlesha born are talkative and know how to impress others by smooth glib. Since the lord of the sign, Chandra (Moon), indicates the masses, their smooth talk helps them attain public offices. They also make successful politicians. But they seldom fulfill their promises. They have respect only for themselves. They know how to generate good publicity for themselves, even through the simplest acts of life. On the positive side, these people can make some of the best statesmen, given a favorable combination of planets like Guru (Jupiter), Sūrya (Sun) and Mangala (Mars).\n</span></div><div><span style=\"font-size: 1rem;\">\n</span></div><div><span style=\"font-size: 1rem;\">Arts or the commerce faculties suit these people for education.

In order to escape from such sight, it is the ancient traditional practice that the neighbors grow bamboos on the border or fences of their houses. Probably the bamboos have magnetic power to catch both sight and sound\n</span></div><div><span style=\"font-size: 1rem;\">\n</span></div><div><span style=\"font-size: 1rem;\"><b>Male Natives</b>\n</span></div><div><span style=\"font-size: 1rem;\">\n</span></div><div><span style=\"font-size: 1rem;\">1.

Character and general events: He will not be grateful to anybody even to those who have given him life. Outwardly he tends to show that he is very sincere and would like to share the tragedy of others but he is not like that. He is very talkative. One of the added advantages is that he can attract people with hypocritical words and he is fit to man various organizations. Since there is an inherent quality of leadership and eagerness to reach the top he can shine very well in the political field. In spite of all those mentioned above, which may appear to be an adverse indication of the character, he is the most intelligent person who can give suitable leadership to a country.\n</span></div><div><span style=\"font-size: 1rem;\">\n</span></div><div><span style=\"font-size: 1rem;\">It is also seen that some Ashlesha born who are cowards, poor-hearted and soft-spoken.

Even then it is seen that he mostly associates himself with black marketers, thieves and murderers. He does not keep any distinction between rich and poor, good and bad people. He does not like to have any resistance to his independence from any circle and has a good liking towards the persons who are ready to accept his leadership and obey his orders whether in the negative or in the positive approach. To such persons he is ready to sacrifice anything. He never likes to cheat others nor he likes to engulf others property. But it is seen that he is quite often mistaken by others.\n</span></div><div><span style=\"font-size: 1rem;\">\n</span></div><div><span style=\"font-size: 1rem;\">One of the drawbacks with the Ashlesha born is that his brain always supports the persons who are not in need and reject the request of the persons who are in need. Suppose he renders a helping hand to a needy person he will not hesitate to publicize such act.\n</span></div><div><span style=\"font-size: 1rem;\">\n</span></div><div><span style=\"font-size: 1rem;\">Whatever may be the plus and minus points in the Ashlesha born, it is generally noticed that he is luckiest, popular but hot-tempered person. If anybody closely watches him it will be seen that he loses his temper where it is not required and where it is required he keeps silent. On the one side when we say that the Ashlesha born is luckiest, the fruit of that lucky existence cannot be enjoyed by him.\n</span></div><div><span style=\"font-size: 1rem;\">\n</span></div><div><span style=\"font-size: 1rem;\">Mostly he is betrayed by the relations and friends and helping hand is extended by the unknown.\n</span></div><div><span style=\"font-size: 1rem;\">\n</span></div><div><span style=\"font-size: 1rem;\">3.

When they undertake any task, they will not leave any stone unturned till they achieve the success. They will work in the same way for others, while serving in an employee's capacity.

This inherent quality produces a vibration on others and it becomes difficult to leave the native once such acquaintance takes place. He can easily get respect and honor from the public. He is always in readiness to help the needy for nothing in return. He does not like to deceive others even if it costs him his life. In spite of this good quality, the reward he gets in return is nothing but criticism and opposition. He does not believe in a posh living.\n</p><p>\n</p><p>Unlike other Nakshatra born persons, the life of Hasta native is full of frequent ups and down. At one moment he rises to the top and another moment he falls to the bottom whether in profession al field or in the mental world. In other words, luck and unluck comes to them without intimation. Hence we cannot categorize him as a permanent poor or wealthy. When he enters in a particular field and starts gaining the object, reversal is already in store for him. While he tries to get out of such reversal with his own effort, helps comes to him from the unexpected quarters and he achieves medium success in the undertaking. It may appear that there is some hidden curse on the native as otherwise, the sincerity and hard work which he shows in every work, should have given him a wonderful boost.\n</p><p>\n</p><p>While the native does not want to cause any trouble to others, once he is hurt, he will always be in search of revenge, but at the same time takes consolation in the feet of god by thinking that let god give him the punishment and he slowly withdraws from the scene of conflict.\n</p><p>\n</p><p>3. Education, sources of earning/profession: In the work field, he keeps strict discipline. Normally employment in a subordinate level is not fit for him. Only very few cases where the Hasta native is working in a low level job has been found. Most of the cases either they are engaged in business or in a high position in the industries.\n</p><p>\n</p><p>Hasta native even with a preliminary academic background will possess excellent all-round knowledge. He will show to the world that he is not being anybody on any matter. He is a good adviser as he has the capacity to intervene and settle various disputed matters. Lot of responsibilities will have to be undertaken by him before he can climb one step of ladder of success.\n</p><p>\n</p><p>Period up to his 30th years of age will bring in unexpected circumstantial changes both in the family front as well as in the academic and professional or business field. Period between 30 to 42 years of his age will be his golden period, when the native can settle down in his life. If the native lives beyond 64 years of age, there will be remarkable accumulation of wealth and all-round success in the business field.\n</p><p>\n</p><p>4. Family life: He is able to enjoy an idle married life, even though occasional friction as is expected in a family will definitely be there. His wife will be a homely lady with all good qualities expected from a house wife. One of the hidden factors noticed in the wife of a Hasta native is that she may indulge in homo-sexual activities in her youth period.\n</p><p>\n</p><p>5. Health: He is prone to have severe cough and cold, frequent emanation of water from the nose and clotting of such fluid, asthma or cynos.\n</p><p>\n</p><p><b>Female Natives\n</b></p><p><span style=\"font-size: 1rem;\">Female natives born in Hasta Nakshatra also will enjoy more or less the same results as mentioned for a male native born in Hasta native. In addition, they will also enjoy the following results:&nbsp;</span><br></p><p>\n</p><p>1. Physical features: Her eyes and ears will be extremely beautiful and entirely different from those born in other Nakshatras. A typical shoulder. Very attractive with soft body.\n</p><p>\n</p><p>2. Character and general events: She will have the inherent shyness of a female sex. While she will respect the elders, she may not like to live like a slave. She will not hesitate to express her views openly. She is not bothered about the outcome of such expression. Hence she is subjected to enmity from her relatives. If she curbs the tendency of open expression of her views she can attain good amount of success in the family front and enjoy her life in full.\n</p><p>\n</p><p>3. Education, sources of earning/profession: In most of the cases, hasta female is not employed mainly due to good financial stability of her parents as well as her husband. In some cases it has been noticed that hasta female, if born in a poor family is employed in the agricultural field and in the construction activities.\n</p><p>\n</p><p>4. Family life: She can enjoy a happy married life. Her husband will be wealthy and loving. She can enjoy good benefit from her children. First will be a son and followed by two daughters.\n</p><p>\n</p><p>5. Health: Her health will generally be good. However, she may have high blood pressure and twisting of veins, asthma in her old age.</p><p>\n            </p></div>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n</section>",

The pride of this native needs to be controlled for self-expression to be positive and devoid of selfishness.\n</p><p><i>2nd Pada:</i> The second pada in the Virgo Navamsa is governed by Mercury, and the focus here is on learning discrimination, self-discipline, and taking part in group activities. It has been observed that ambitions usually come to fruition in this pada.\n</p><p><i>3rd Pada: </i>The third pada of this Chitra Nakshatra falls in the Libra Navamsa and is governed by Venus. The focus is on music, arts and the exotic sciences. It is also likened to unnecessary expenses and an undoing of good work.\n</p><p><i>4th Pada:</i> The fourth pada of this Nakshatra comes in the Scorpio Navamsa and is ruled by Mars. There is an excess of energy here which is used to pursue all kinds of ambitions, and even flimsy goals. A conscious effort has to be made to channelize the energy in a positive manner.</p><p><br></p><p><b>Other aspects of this Nakshatra:\n</b></p><p>The Purushardha (life's vector or motivation) is Kama. \n</p><p>Totem animal is Tiger (female). \n</p><p>Symbol - a pearl. \n</p><p>Devata (Deity) - Tvashtar. \n</p><p>Dosha - Pitta.\n</p><p>\n</p><p><br></p><p>This is the 14th Nakshatra of zodiac, ruled by the fiery planet Mangala (Mars). It spans from 26°40' in Kanya (Virgo) to 6°40' in Tula (Libra). Thus the first two quarters of this Nakshatra fall in the sign Kanya (Virgo) while the last two quarters fall in the sign Tula (Libra).\n</p><p>\n</p><p>Chitra born enjoy good health and always appear much younger than their actual age. They may appear rather thin and weak, but they have excellent stamina and muscle power. These people are gifted with power of intuition, a quality that is a must for any astrologer. Hence these people are suitable for any profession that requires forecasting over a longer period.\n</p><p>\n</p><p>When the Mangala is strong in the natal chart, a Chitra born will be rather insensitive to the feelings of other. It is not that he wants to hurt others through his behavior, but this characteristic will be an integral part of his nature.\n</p><p>\n</p><p>These people do not like to be subdued by others. Hence, they have to face opposition in every walk of life. A strong Mangala in this case will give the necessary courage to the native to take on the world. But a weak Mangala will only generate hatred for those who oppose the native.\n</p><p>\n</p><p>Because they have to face the ire of world for having their own say, they are considerate towards the people who are in the same situation and like to help these people.\n</p><p>\n</p><p>These people suffer from ailments of kidney. Possibility of brain fever also can not be ruled out, especially when either of Mangala or Sūrya (Sun) is placed in Mesha (Aries).\n</p><p>\n</p><p><b><br></b></p><p><b>Male Natives\n</b></p><p>\n<span style=\"font-size: 1rem;\">1. Physical features: He has a lean body. He can be recognized or identified even from a crowd of hundreds of people through his magnificent dealings and expressions.&nbsp;</span></p><p>\n</p><p>2. Character and general events: He is very very intelligent and peace loving. He will not hesitate to go to any extreme for the sake of selfish benefits. There is a hidden inherent Godly gift for this Nakshatra born i.e., the ideas or opinions or advice expressed by him would initially appear to be a sheer nonsense but later on the same idea or opinion or advice will only prevail upon. There is also an inherent gift of intuition. Hence he is the type of person who is very much fit for the astrological profession where intuition is very much needed.\n</p><p>\n</p><p>In some cases, it is also noticed that the native quite often see a lot of dreams which are actually becoming true. This would indirectly indicate that a divine power is automatically installed in the brain of Chitra born.\n</p><p>\n</p><p>He is the type of person who is not bothered about the sentiments of others nor is he selfish to others. But in spite of this adamant attitude his dealings with the poorer section of the society will be very cordial and full of kindness. Quite often he is mistaken by others that he is very rude and stingy. He has a tendency of giving reply on any matter without forethought and he wakes up at the eleventh hour and try to rectify his utterances when it is too late.\n</p><p>\n</p><p>He has to confront his enemies at every step but he is capable of escaping any conspiracy. He has soft corner for the down trodden people and he devotes his time and energy for the uplift of this section of the society. But one of the hidden factors is that initially his approach to the down trodden will be without any selfish motive, which later on culminates into selfish motive.\n</p><p>\n</p><p>3. Education, sources of earnings / profession: Obstacles in the life is not a hurdle for the advancement for him. He can overtake all these hurdles with his courage and hard work. He will not be leading a comfortable life up to the age of 32 years. Period between 33 years and 54 years of age will be his golden period.\n</p><p>\n</p><p>One of the redeeming features of Chitra born is that he gets help and reward from unexpected quarters without putting much efforts. It is seen that the age of 22, 27, 30, 36, 39, 43 and 48 years of age will be very bad in all respect. The native may earn as a sculptor or mechanic or as a factory employee or the native will be in the political arena or the native may be be an engineer or a textile technologist.\n</p><p>\n</p><p>4. Family life: While on the one hand he sincerely loves his co-borns, and parents, on the other hand he suspects the activities of the co-borns and parents. Chitra born cannot, in most of the cases enjoy the benefit, love and affection from his father. It is also noticed that the father of the native leads a separate life with second family. In any case, he has a life away from his father. One of the points noticed is that his father in spite of separation from the native have some distinct identity of his own i.e., will be famous or known in a particular field. He wants to be more attached to his father and however enjoy benefits from the maternal side.\n</p><p>\n</p><p>There is a saying that the Chitra born cannot stay in the house where he is born. Either the native will leave the house and settle down somewhere else or the house he is born itself will be sold or destroyed. In other words, he will be settling down in an unknown and distant place away from his native house.\n</p><p>\n</p><p>Normally he cannot enjoy a happy married life. When we say a happy married life, while the marriage will be stable the relationship between the couples will not be cordial leading to frequent friction on small matters. He has to shoulder lot of responsibilities and face lot of criticisms throughout his life.\n</p><p>\n</p><p>5. Health: Inflammation of kidney and bladder, brain fever, diseases connected with worms. Abdominal tumors or appendicitis also have been noticed.\n</p><p>\n</p><p><b><br></b></p><p><b>Female Natives\n</b></p><p>\n<span style=\"font-size: 1rem;\">Females born in this Nakshatra will also equally enjoy the same results mentioned above for the male natives, except that the females are more subjected to the hands of unlucky fate.&nbsp;</span></p><p>\n</p><p>1. Physical features: She has a beautiful envious body. She will be tall with equally matched fleshy body. While she has natural long hair, she in the modern world will have a cut hair.\n</p><p>\n</p><p>2. Character and general events: Her eagerness for excess of freedom and unrespectable behavior makes problems still complicated. She is proud for no merits. A veracious and sinful, laziness. She will have very few friends. Commits sinful deeds.\n</p><p>\n</p><p>3. Education, sources of earnings / profession: She will have her education in science subjects. She may be a nurse or a model or a film actress. If planets are not well or moderately placed, she may be employed in agricultural field.\n</p><p>\n</p><p>4. Family life: Unless the horoscope of a female native is compared properly there is likelihood of death of the partner, divorce or complete absence of pleasure from the husband. In some cases, childlessness is also noticed. She is advised to observe the remedial measures mentioned at the end of this mentioned at the end of this chapter for a happy existence.</p><p>\n            </p></div>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n</section>",

The node Rahu rules this Nakshatra. The entire span of this Nakshatra falls in the sign Tula (Libra), the sign ruled by the lord of beauty, Shukra (Venus). These people have beautiful physical appearance, a well-balanced body. Females born in this sign and Nakshatra walk as if they are thinking deep before taking every step and trying to balance their body before taking any further action.\n</p><p>\n</p><p>A well-balanced behavior is the essence of their life.

They do not like to do any injustice to others neither do they like any injustice being done to them. But these people are adamant, and they do not like the criticism of their work. A large number of those born in Swati earn their living trough the jobs or businesses involved in traveling.\n</p><p>\n</p><p>These people are intelligent and hardworking, but they have to face difficulties in the early part of their life. This is same even for the people who are born in the wealthiest families. But they early struggle serves well for these people, as they start seeing the path clearly ahead of them. The experiences learned in the early part of life serve well.\n</p><p>\n</p><p>A strong Shukra (Venus) or Rahu in case of those born in this Nakshatra makes the native good in art work related with the trade of cloth, jewellery, valuable stones, etc. A conjunction of moon with Shukra (Venus) will make the native extremely beautiful and lucky. These people will gain in every assignment they undertake. But in case of a beneficial aspect of Chandra (Moon) with Mangala (Mars), the native may serve in the defense forces or may earn through any of the outdoor games.\n</p><p>\n</p><p>When the lord of this Nakshatra, Rahu, is placed in the first house, the native will be short in height, slightly obese. When Rahu is placed in the seventh house, there will be some kind of difference in the wife and husband.

The focus here is on the emotional turmoil, and how to overcome it, because it is a very risky state of mind.</p><p><span style=\"font-size: 1rem;\"><br></span></p><p><b><span style=\"font-size: 1rem;\">Other aspects of this Nakshatra:&nbsp;</span><br><span style=\"font-size: 1rem;\"></span></b></p><p>The Purushartha (life's vector or motivation) is Dharma. \n</p><p>Totem animal is Tiger (male). \n</p><p>Symbols: a potter's wheel or an archway. \n</p><p>Devata (Deity) - Shakragni (Indra and Agni).\n</p><p>Dosha - Kapha.\n</p><p>\n</p><p>This is the 16th Nakshatra of the zodiac, spanning from 20°00' in Tula to 3°20' in Vrshchika. Hence its first three quarters fall in the sign Tula, while the last quarter falls in the sign Vrshchika. While the Nakshatra Vishakha is ruled by the wise planet Jupiter, Tula is ruled by Venus and Vrshchika is ruled by Mars. Guru (Jupiter) and Mangala (Mars) is a friendly combination, while Guru (Jupiter) and Shukra (Venus) belong to the opposite camps. As a result, while the last quarter of this Nakshatra brings to fore all the bright side of Guru (Jupiter) and Mangala (Mars), people born on in the first three quarters are more interested in the material pleasures.\n</p><p><span style=\"font-size: 1rem;\">Vishakha born have a well-proportioned body, but they tend to be obese and put on weight with the passing of age. Females born in this Nakshatra are beautiful and religious in nature. They need to have a well balanced diet and should exercise regularly to keep them fit.&nbsp;</span><br></p><p><span style=\"font-size: 1rem;\">These people are god fearing and like to be guided by truth. For those born in the first three quarters of Vishakha, balance is the nature of life, as they always try to avoid extremes. This is apparent in their religious beliefs as well, with these people neither being too dogmatic nor too advanced when it comes to religion. But those born in Vrshchika are very firm in their belief, rarely changing their views. But generally, a Vishakha born is secular in his or her religious beliefs.&nbsp;</span><br></p><p><span style=\"font-size: 1rem;\">A well placed Chandra (Moon) and Buddha (Mercury) make these people crowd pullers. Good Buddha (Mercury) also bestows them with good oratory skills. Females born in Vishakha have a sweet tongue and quiet diplomatic in their choice of words.&nbsp;</span><br></p><p><span style=\"font-size: 1rem;\">These people do not like the idea of working for others. They are better suited for independent businesses. Consultancy is a good profession for them, as these people possess the required skills for the same. A Vishakha born consultant, born in the Vrshchika will rarely reveal information about his clients to others. For this reason, they are also suited for jobs that involve high levels of responsibility.&nbsp;</span><br></p><p><span style=\"font-size: 1rem;\">These people normally enjoy good health. They are full of vigor and enthusiasm, often working long hours continuously. Because of their addiction to certain kinds of food and the tendency to neglect their health, they may suffer sudden attacks involving the nerves system.&nbsp;</span><br></p><p>\n</p><p><b>Male Natives\n</b></p><p><span style=\"font-size: 1rem;\">1. Physical Features: His face will be round, bright and physical appearance extremely attractive. We have noticed two types of physical appearance i.e. one with fatty and long structure and the other with very lean and short structure.&nbsp;</span><br></p><p><span style=\"font-size: 1rem;\">2. Character and general events: He will have full of vigor and vitality as also intelligence of the highest order. He is firm believer of god and leads a life of truthful existence. He does not believe in the orthodox principles not the age old tradition. He is fond of adopting modern ideas.&nbsp;</span><br></p><p><span style=\"font-size: 1rem;\">Mostly he lives away from his family. He is ready to give weight to others in excess of what is actually required depending on the weight of the persons to whom he is dealing in. Slavery is suicidal for him. While he is very much religiously active, he does not follow any superstitious religious fanaticism. He treats all religions, castes and creed as one. He is a follower of Gandhian philosophy of 'Ahimsa Paramodharma' (Religion is non-violence or The most preferable and auspicious Dharma is non-violence) and 'Truth is God'. In certain cases I have seen that such type of persons accept Sanyasa (saintism) when they touch 35 years of age. When we sanyasa it does not mean that complete detraction from the 'Grihastashram' (duty towards the family). He will simultaneously look after the family and follow sanyasa.&nbsp;</span><br></p><p><span style=\"font-size: 1rem;\">3. Education, sources of earning/profession: He is a very good orator and has the capacity to attract crowd. He will win several prizes in elocution competition. Hence he is the fittest person to be in the political circle. There is a peculiar spending tendency in him. While on the one side he is very stingy on the spending on the other side he is extravagant in the spending where it is not required.&nbsp;</span><br></p><p><span style=\"font-size: 1rem;\">He is fit for doing an independent business, job involving high responsibility, banking and religious professions, mathematician or a teacher or a printer.&nbsp;</span><br></p><p><span style=\"font-size: 1rem;\">4. Family life: He cannot enjoy love and affection of mother. One of the primary reasons for such lack of care may either due to mother's death or unavoidable circumstances and atmosphere which warrant his mother to be away from the native. There may be several beneficial points of his father with which he can always be proud of. Even then, not much help will be derived from his father also. In other words, we have to come to a conclusion that the native leads more or less a life of an orphan. There may be a lot of difference of opinion between his father and him on several points where an amicable settlement on any matter may not be possible. It is due to these reasons he is right from the childhood a hardworking and self made person.&nbsp;</span><br></p><p><span style=\"font-size: 1rem;\">He loves his wife and children very much. Even so, he has two bad qualities. One is that he is addicted to alcohol and another is that he indulges in too much sex with other ladies. In spite of these weaknesses he will not make this weaknesses as hindrance either in the family or social life.&nbsp;</span><br></p><p><span style=\"font-size: 1rem;\">5. Health: Since has has inherent vigor and vitality given by the god, his health will normally be very good. However, he is prone to paralytic attack. I have in more than 70 percent of Vishakha born people noticed this paralytic attack after the age of 55 years. In the remaining 30 percent cases, I have every doubt that the native could not provide me the correct birth time as otherwise the same symptom of paralytic attack would have in one form or the other present in them. It is also seen that they are prone to asthmatic attack.&nbsp;</span><br></p><p>\n</p><p><b>Female Natives\n</b></p><p><span style=\"font-size: 1rem;\">Females born in this Nakshatra will enjoy more or less the same results mentioned for the male natives and in addition they will enjoy the following results:&nbsp;</span><br></p><p>\n</p><p>1. Physical features: Her features extremely beautiful. This inherent godly gift of attractive physical features normally attract the men folk and she has to face lot of problems on this account.\n</p><p><span style=\"font-size: 1rem;\">2. Character and general events: She has a very sweet tongue. She is expert in the household activities and if employed in the official activities also. Arrogance is very rarely noticed in these females. She does not believe in pomp and show and she is very simple. She does not like to increase her beauty by make up. She is subject to jealousy of other female friends and relatives. She is a firm believer of religious principles and quite often observe fast and perform poojas and visit holy places frequently.&nbsp;</span><br></p><p><span style=\"font-size: 1rem;\">3. Education, sources of earning/profession: She is interested in poetry. If there are other good planetary combinations, particularly when Moon and Venus are together, she may become a famous writer. She will have academic excellence in arts or literature.&nbsp;</span><br></p><p><span style=\"font-size: 1rem;\">4. Family life: She treats her husband as her god. Her religious attitude will confer love and affection from her in-laws. As she looks after the welfare of all family members and even distant relations, she will have power and authority conferred on her. She will have more attachment to her father-in-law. She may frequently be visiting sacred places.&nbsp;</span><br></p><p>\n<span style=\"font-size: 1rem;\">5. Health: She will generally have good health. However, she is prone to kidney trouble, goiter and weakness due to homo-sexuality.</span></p><p>\n            </p></div>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n</section>",

While the planet of hardships and efforts, Shani (Saturn), rules this Nakshatra, the fiery and aggressive planet, Mangala (Mars), rules the sign. Mangala (Mars) and Shani (Saturn) are mutual enemies, having some of the most different characteristics. Thus, people born in this Nakshatra also show some very peculiar characteristics.\n</p><p><span style=\"font-size: 1rem;\">Anuradha born children are somewhat weak in the beginning, but become stronger as they grow up. These people have a good height, lean and yet strong physique. As a rule, Anuradha born have to face several obstacles in their life, and hence they have a somewhat defeated look on their face. They are fairly straight forward, but if they get a feeling that some one is unnecessarily creating obstacles in their path, then Anuradha born are likely to harbor a feeling to take the revenge. These people are ready to wait long for the opportune moment to take the final action.&nbsp;</span><br></p><p><span style=\"font-size: 1rem;\">While Mangala (Mars) gives them the soldierly abilities to march forward and achieve the objectives at any cost, the planet of efforts, Shani (Saturn), enables them to keep on trying again and again till they reach their destination. These people have an independent nature and will do anything to preserve their independence. This fiercely independent nature also makes them start earning at a very young age. But the lord of Nakshatra, Shani (Saturn), makes them struggle at every step till the second half of their life, after which, they enjoy a smooth sailing.&nbsp;</span><br></p><p><span style=\"font-size: 1rem;\">Anuradha born, are not on good terms with their parents and other close relations. Seldom anyone from these relations becomes helpful for their progress in life. On the other hand, their spouse gives them the all round support necessary to make their marriage a success.&nbsp;</span><br></p><p>\n</p><p><b>Male Natives\n</b></p><p><span style=\"font-size: 1rem;\">1. Physical features: The native will have a beautiful face with bright eyes. In some cases where combination of planets is not good, the native has cruel looks.&nbsp;</span><br></p><p><span style=\"font-size: 1rem;\">2. Character and general events: He is liable to face several obstacles in his life. Even then he has special aptitude to handle the most difficult situation in a systematic way. However, if we look at his face, a peculiar frustrated face can be noticed. The main reason for such a gloomy appearance is the problems, which he has to confront on several occasions. to be more specific, there will not be peace of mind in his life. Even a smallest problem will start pinching his mind repeatedly runs after one and the same problem.&nbsp;</span><br></p><p><span style=\"font-size: 1rem;\">He always think of taking revenge whenever opportunity comes. In spite of these drawbacks he is the most hardworking and ever ready to complete the task before him. Come what may, march forward is the motto of this native. In addition it can be said that after several reversals he ultimately achieves the desired result.&nbsp;</span><br></p><p><span style=\"font-size: 1rem;\">He is a firm believer of god. He cannot keep a permanent stable relationship with anybody. His life is full of helplessness but independent. Even in several reversals he will not leave optimism.&nbsp;</span><br></p><p><span style=\"font-size: 1rem;\">3. Education, sources of earning/profession: He can be successful in the business field. If he is employed he has a special caliber of how to pocket his superiors. He starts earning his bread at quite young age say on or about 17 or 18 years of age. Life between the period of 17 years to 48 years of age will be full of problems. When it's said \"full of problems\", it does not mean that there will not be any good period in between the above-mentioned period. Occasional benefits and favorable results will be definitely noticed. The life after the age of 48 years will be extremely good. It is in this period he can settle down in his life to the desired way and become free from most of the miseries of the life. If Chandra (Moon) is in the company of  Mangala (Mars), he may be a person dealing with drugs and chemicals or a doctor.&nbsp;</span><br></p><p><span style=\"font-size: 1rem;\">4. Family life: No benefit will be derived from the co-borns under any circumstances. He cannot enjoy or derive any benefit from his father. In some cases, frequent friction with his father has also been noticed. Same way there is no luck of receiving love and affection from the mother also. Normally, he settles down away from the place of his birth. Even though several adverse results have been commented above, one of the favorable points is that his married life will be completely satisfactory. His spouse will have all the qualities of a good housewife. As is the god's gift, he always looks back to his life while dealing with his own children and at any cost he likes to provide all necessities of life as far as possible and the love and affection. Hence his children reach a height position, much more than that of the native.&nbsp;</span><br></p><p><span style=\"font-size: 1rem;\">5. Health: His health will generally be good. He will be prone to asthmatic attack, dental problems, cough and cold, constipation and sore throat. Due to non-care nature of his own health he does not take medicines properly.&nbsp;</span><br></p><p><span style=\"font-size: 1rem;\"><br></span></p><p><b><span style=\"font-size: 1rem;\">Female Natives&nbsp;</span><br></b></p><p><b>\n</b></p><p>1.

Character and general events: There is no room for arrogance in her life. She is pure-hearted. She does not believe a life of fashion whereas she likes to lead a simple life. A selfless, agreeable and attractive disposition. She can shine well in social and political field. She will respect her elders. Her friends will cordon her as if she is the head of friend's circle.\n</p><p>\n</p><p>3. Education, sources of earning/profession: She will be more interested in music and fine arts. She may obtain an academic degree or high degree of knowledge in music or dance. Professional dancers are also found to have been born in this Nakshatra.\n</p><p>\n</p><p>4.

Her devotion to her in-laws pours further glory in her personal life.\n</p><p>\n</p><p>5. Health: She may suffer from irregular menses. Severe pain will be felt at the time of bleeding, as the flow of spoiled blood will be quite intermittent. In some cases it has been told that, after appearance of monthly menses, there will be break for some hours or for one or two days before commencing actual flow.

This Nakshatra is owned by the planet of intelligence Buddha (Mercury), while the fiery Mangala (Mars) owns this sign. As a result, people born in this Nakshatra possess a mix of the qualities of Buddha (Mercury) and Mangala (Mars). While they are aggressive to the core, their aggressiveness is more on the intellectual level. A good lawyer or politician with excellent oratory skills, and ever ready to pounce on his opponents with strong verbal attacks is a peculiarity of this Nakshatra.\n</p><p>\n</p><p>Jyeshtha born have excellent physical stamina and a good physical appearance. But these people are rather soft when it comes to dealing with some really difficult problems in their life, where a firm decision has to be made and implemented with a firm mind. They are much talkative, hence are unable to keep a secret a secret. To get on well with others, they should try to control their temper and be ready to accept the advice given by others. These qualities make them appear like a very proud person, but the facts are actually different.\n</p><p>\n</p><p>The key to success in life for Jyeshtha born is to control their behavior in every walk of life. This includes their eating habits as well. If this happens, their sincere nature will take them to the most senior position available in the hierarchy where they work. These people are also not very clear about the profession they want to pursue for life, and hence keep on changing jobs or the lines of business often. This is the outcome of the dual nature of the planet  Buddha (Mercury), the ruler of this Nakshatra.\n</p><p>\n</p><p>In case of family relations, these people are not very lucky.

Physical features: He has a very good physical stamina and attractive countenance.

But these good qualities will not be noticed by others as he does not believe in show. He cannot face even a small problem. He is the type of person to whom no secret should be told or given. He cannot keep anything hidden in his mind even if it pertains to his own life. Unless he keeps it open to others he feels that something is missing in his life and good sleep is disturbed. Several persons born in this Nakshatra have been coming to me and complaining that they do get good sleep. When the reason for such a state of affairs was inquired into, they have all admitted that a peculiar vibration takes place in their mind and unless the reason for that vibration is leaked out they cannot rest. So they always wait for the next morning and try to tell these things to the persons who meet them first.\n</p><p>\n</p><p>He is hot tempered and obstinate. Due to this temperament he often faces a lot of problems and forms a wall to his progress in life. He never accepts the advice given by others+, whereas he acts upon his own consciousness.\n</p><p>\n</p><p>For the sake of principle he takes on the spot decisions on several matters without seeing the opportunity and circumstances, which ultimately leads him to a precarious state. Due to the condition of the hot temperament he will not hesitate to cause problems and troubles even to those who rendered him all possible help when required and even ill treat those persons. He cannot expect any help from the relations. Outwardly, he appears to be very proud but when we go closer to him it will be evident that it is just the opposite.\n</p><p>\n</p><p>He must keep away all drugs and alcohol as he is prone to go out of control quickly which will spoil his hard earned reputation, put an hindrance to his profession as also in the family life.\n</p><p>\n</p><p>3.

Period from 27th years of age will be a beginning of progress towards stability, even though the pace will be very slow up to his 50 years of age.\n</p><p>\n</p><p>4. Family life: He cannot expect any benefit from his mother and co-borns, whereas they become his enemies. He is generally disliked by his near and dear ones. This is mainly due to the fact that Jyeshta born likes to keep a separate identity and existence.\n</p><p>\n</p><p>His spouse will always have an upper hand and resist tooth and nail the activity of intoxication. While his married life will be completely harmonious and enjoy to the maximum occasional health problems of his wife or separation due to some unavoidable circumstances will greatly affect the mind of the native.\n</p><p>\n</p><p>5. Health: Frequent temperature, dysentery, cough and cold, asthmatic attach and stomach problems are the possible diseases.

Education, sources of income/profession: She is active in sports. Medium academic education. She is often contended herself in the home, seeking to enrich her own life through her husband's success. Hence most of the Jyeshta born females are not involved in any earning job.\n</p><p>\n</p><p>4. Family life: She lacks marital harmony and loss of children is also noticed. In some cases it has been that such native is subject to harassment by in-laws and several concoctions stories are framed against her. She has to be very very careful while dealing with her neighbors and relatives as they are persons who put poison in her life. A worry-less period is very rarely available for her. Since she makes her own rule to be abide by her children, she will be neglected by her children as a vengeance to what she has done to them during childhood.\n</p><p>\n</p><p>5. Health: Her health will not be so good. It is seen that some of the females born in this Nakshatra suffer from disorder of the uterus. She is also prone to prostrate gland enlargement or pain in arms and shoulders.</p></div>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n</section>",

This is a Nakshatra owned by the node Ketu, the entire span of this Nakshatra falls in the sign Dhanu, owned by the auspicious planet Guru (Jupiter). While Guru is the planet of wisdom, Ketu indicates hard work or Tapasya. Hence the people born on this Nakshatra gain the wisdom and knowledge through their hard work. They have their own set of principles to live by.\n</p><p>\n<span style=\"font-size: 1rem;\">Natives born on this Nakshatra are tall and have a good physical appearance. They are peace loving personalities, but will not hesitate to fight for what rightfully belongs to them. It is widely believed that a Moola born person becomes harmful to his/her parents. This is because the meaning of the word, Moola means the root. Hence the perception that a Moola born is harmful to his/her parents. But this is largely unjustified. A valuable piece of material lost on this Nakshatra will be found out by its owner, as the word Moola also means 'getting back to the square one'.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style=\"font-size: 1rem;\">These people are good advisers. These people have multiple skills and hence, change of professions is a regular feature for these people. They are also good advisers and act as consultants.&nbsp;</span><br></p><p><span style=\"font-size: 1rem;\">Moola born are frequent spend thrifts, spending their money recklessly. But they do not resort to unfair means to earn money to support their expenditure. Moola people are also very devoted in their relations, be it friendship, marriage, partnership or employment. They are really devoted and continue with these relations even during the most trying times.&nbsp;</span><br></p><p><span style=\"font-size: 1rem;\">Out of all the family relations, these people do not enjoy good equation with their parents, while their married life is more or less satisfactory.&nbsp;</span><br></p><p>\n</p><p><b>Male Natives\n</b></p><p><span style=\"font-size: 1rem;\">1. Physical features: He has good physical appearance. He will have beautiful limbs and bright eyes. He will be the most attractive person in his family.&nbsp;</span><br></p><p><span style=\"font-size: 1rem;\">2. Character and general events: He has a very sweet nature and is a peace loving person. He has a set principle in his life. There is a general fear about the persons born in Moola Nakshatra. It isn't like that always. He can stand against any adverse tidal wave. He has the capacity to penetrate that wave and reach the destination.&nbsp;</span><br></p><p><span style=\"font-size: 1rem;\">He is not bothered about tomorrow nor he is very serious about his own matters. He keeps all the happenings in the hands of god and become prey to optimism.&nbsp;</span><br></p><p>\n3<span style=\"font-size: 1rem;\">. Education, sources of earning/profession: He does not keep control of the balance of receipt and payment resulting in debt. He is the type of person who renders advice to others but not capable of keeping the same principles for his own use. This peculiar characteristic generally fits them for the profession of financial advise or religious advice.&nbsp;</span></p><p>\nS<span style=\"font-size: 1rem;\">ince he is skilled in several fields there will be frequent changes of profession or trade but stability in this direction seems to be a very rare phenomenon. Because of this inherent quality of frequent changes he is always in need of money. Moola born have a peculiar characteristic of mixing with his friends. It is quite natural that when expenditure is more than income and the native is not ready to earn anything by illegal mode the balance will always be in the negative. Hence it is advisable that he must keep away such friends and while he believes that all that is taking place on the earth is due to the blessings of HE, he should also try to be a little selfish and find a way to improve the inflow of income.&nbsp;</span></p><p>\nO<span style=\"font-size: 1rem;\">ut of all the 28 Nakshatras, I have come to a conclusion that these are the people who devote their entire energy with utmost sincerity to their employers as also to any persons who have kept faith or trust in Moola born. A deep study of the life of these persons has revealed some facts about their separate entity than other Nakshatra born i.e. some sort of internal force or some external force is briefing the natives in all the work they undertake.&nbsp;</span></p><p>\nH<span style=\"font-size: 1rem;\">e earns his livelihood in a foreign place. It is advisable that he must, as far as possible, try to get an opportunity either in the professional field or in the business field in a foreign land or country as he cannot have good luck in the native place; whereas he can have much better success in a foreign land.&nbsp;</span></p><p>\nA<span style=\"font-size: 1rem;\">s already mentioned above, he is capable of shining in all walks of life, particularly i the field of fine arts, as a writer and in the social work.&nbsp;</span></p><p>\n4<span style=\"font-size: 1rem;\">. Family life: Excepting a few cases, it is seen that Moola born cannot have any benefit from his parents whereas he is all self-made. His married life will be more or less satisfactory. He gets a spouse with all the requisite qualities expected from a good wife.&nbsp;</span></p><p>\n<span style=\"font-size: 1rem;\">5. Health: Probable problems he will be affected with are tuberculosis, isnofelia, paralytic attack or stomach problem. Whatever may be the nature of disease it will not be visible in his appearance or face as even when he is critically ill, his expression and the attraction of the face will not change. Normally it is seen that the native is not in the habit of taking care of his own health. With the result, some severe health problems can be noticed in his 27th, 31st, 44th, 48th, 56th and 60th age.&nbsp;</span></p><p>\n<span style=\"font-size: 1rem;\">Once he is addicted to any drug it will be very difficult to control such addiction. Hence it must try to keep away from any material of intoxication.&nbsp;</span></p><p>\n</p><p><b>Female Native\n</b></p><p><span style=\"font-size: 1rem;\">1. Physical features: Medium complexion - neither black nor white or swarthy in hot countries. Reddish color in cold countries. Her principal teeth will not be close with great distance, wealthy sign.&nbsp;</span><br></p><p><span style=\"font-size: 1rem;\">2. Character and general events: Mostly these natives are pure-hearted. However, obstinacy cannot be ruled out. Even on small matters she will be very much adamant. Since she lacks knack of dealing she quite often lands into problems.&nbsp;</span><br></p><p><span style=\"font-size: 1rem;\">3. Education, sources of earning/profession: Mostly, Moola born females do not acquire much education. These females don't show any interest in studies. Most of these females spent more than two terms in the same standard or class. Ultimately they leave further education. The only exception is that if Jupiter is placed in opposition i.e. aspects or placed in Magha Nakshatra, the native may be a doctor or employed in an envious position i.e. such females will have excellent academic record and reach to the top.&nbsp;</span><br></p><p><span style=\"font-size: 1rem;\">4. Family life: Females born in this Nakshatra, unlike the males, cannot enjoy full conjugal bliss. she will have a separated life, mainly due to the death of her husband or divorce. This result cannot be blindly applied as other planetary positions of favorable nature will, blindly applied as other planetary positions of favorable nature will, to a certain extent, nullify the bad effects. There may be delay in the marriage and also some hurdles. If the position of Mars is unfavorable she will have to face a lot of problems either from her husband or from children.&nbsp;</span><br></p><p><span style=\"font-size: 1rem;\">5. Health: She is prone to rheumatism, lumbago, hip or back ache combined with pain in arms and shoulders.</span><br></p><p>\n            </p></div>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n</section>",

People born in Poorva Ashadha have a good physique with a tall body. They are intelligent, convincing, tend to get into arguments with others and prove their intelligence through the arguments. But a poorly placed mercury in a duel sign results in these people being in double minds while taking any important decision. While they are good at advising others, they lack the necessary logical reasoning to take a well thought out decision. But there is a tendency to make decisions on impulse and these generally result in making a fool of these people.\n</p><p><span style=\"font-size: 1rem;\">A strong Mangala (Mars) in the natal chart results in making an argumentative, obstinate and quarrelsome personality. They have very close friends. If only these people can overcome their argumentative nature and learn how to make decisions properly, they can rise to almost any levels. They are sincere in their efforts and enough persistence on their part can make miracles.&nbsp;</span><br></p><p><span style=\"font-size: 1rem;\">Compared to the males, the females born in this Nakshatra are sincere and take every step after considering the pros and the cons.

This is good, in the sense that a hastily concluded business deal often ends up putting them in a difficult situation. These people are steady, confident when it comes to being emotional. They do not trust others easily and it is only after spending considerable times with them that others can get an entry into the inner circle of their friends. But an easy way to please them is to please them with flattery.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style=\"font-size: 1rem;\">Uttaraashadha born are natural diplomats. For them, preserving a relationship has the utmost importance.

Even if a thief is caught by him, he will try to find out the truth of the circumstances which led that person to become a thief and if he is convinced he will let that fellow go. His inherent quality if peaceful appearance and the knack of dealings will penetrate to the minds of the public, hence he is fittest politician for the modern times. His one smile is enough for others to be attracted and once he is attracted they cannot forget the native.&nbsp;</span><br></p><p><span style=\"font-size: 1rem;\">Whatever may be the ups and downs in his life, neither he will reach to the top nor he will be at the bottom.

It makes the native happy-go-lucky. Here marriage will be a success. The native will excel in performing arts, astrology, and spirituality.\n</p><p><i>4th Pada: </i>The fourth pada comes in the Scorpio Navamsa ruled by Mars.

This Nakshatra spans from 23°20' in Makara (Capricorn) to 6°40' in Kumbha (Aquarius). While the first half of this Nakshatra falls in the sign Makara (Capricorn), the other half falls in the sign Kumbha (Aquarius). Though both these signs are owned by the same Graha (planet), Shani (Saturn), the characteristics of both these signs differ. Accordingly, the results seen in case of a person born in the Nakshatra Dhanistha with Makara (Capricorn) as the sign will be different form the person born in Dhanishta with Kumbha (Aquarius) as the sign.\n</p><p>\n<span style=\"font-size: 1rem;\">People born in this Nakshatra are lean and tall, with good ability to resist contagious diseases. Females born in this Nakshatra always look younger than their actual age. Dhanishta born are intelligent, versatile and like to keep themselves engaged in a variety of tasks. They are straight minded, do not like to harm others and in turn, expect that nobody should harm them. But the practical life is not that simple. So when the reality strikes, these people get angry and are determined to crush the offender with all their might. But they also have the wisdom to wait for the best opportunity to avenge the damage. If that is not possible in the immediate future, they keep in mind their task and carry it out at an appropriate time.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style=\"font-size: 1rem;\">These people are well educated. For those born in the sign Kumbha (Aquarius), scientific inquiry is the way of life. For them, the profession is also mostly related with science. Earnings through profession/service assume a significant part of their income only around the age of 30 years. Good academic record, street-smart intelligence and a knack for administration make these people an ideal candidate for holding public offices.&nbsp;</span><br></p><p><span style=\"font-size: 1rem;\">A Dhanishta born is seldom happy with his relatives. But his wife knows how to deal with the troubled relations and make the matters simple. These people need to take proper care of their health, as they tend to neglect their health problems till they reach the extreme stage.&nbsp;</span><br></p><p>\n</p><p><b>Male Features\n</b></p><p><span style=\"font-size: 1rem;\">1. Physical features: Normally, the native has a lean body with lengthy figure. In exceptional cases there are some natives with stout figure.&nbsp;</span><br></p><p><span style=\"font-size: 1rem;\">2. Character and general events: He will be expert in all the works he undertakes. He has extremely intelligent mind and all-round knowledge. He does not like to cause any trouble to others \"Manasa, Vacha or Karmana\" (by mind, by word or by work). However, it has been seen that he has religious spirit. He always like to live with his own caliber and effort. He dislikes to express his disagreement with others till the last moment. Most of us are probably aware of the elephant's revenge. That is, if any person or any animal cause trouble to the elephant, the elephant waits for an opportunity to bounce upon them. In the same way Dhanishta born also waits for an opportunity to bounce upon others with whom he has to settle a score.&nbsp;</span><br></p><p><span style=\"font-size: 1rem;\">3. Education, sources of earning/profession: A number of horoscopes examined by me have revealed that most of the scientists and historians are born in this Nakshatra. Since there is an inherent talent of keeping secret, the native is quite suitable for secret service, private secretaries to the senior executives. Whatever may be his academic background his intelligence is beyond questionable. In argument also he is much ahead of others. Hence lawyers profession is the best for him. Normally, period from 24th years of age onwards will show progress in the earning field. Since he will be engaged in the profession or trade where he has to trust others, he should be very very careful before putting trust on others.&nbsp;</span><br></p><p><span style=\"font-size: 1rem;\">4. Family life: In the family circle also he will be the uppermost administrator. His relatives will cause a lot of embarrassment and problems. He is more inclined to his brothers and sisters. He will have ample inherited property subject to the placement of planets in beneficial position. He cannot have much benefit from his in-laws. But this drawback will be nullified due to the presence of good qualities in his wife. His wife will be an incarnation of \"Lakshmi\" (goddess of wealth). To be more specific, any improvement in the financial field of the native will be only after the marriage.&nbsp;</span><br></p><p><span style=\"font-size: 1rem;\">5. Health: His health may not be so good. Even then he will not think of his own health. It is only when the disease reach at the peak he starts finding remedy. Slightest improvement out of the severest disease will drag him to the work field. He is prone to whooping cough, anemia etc. However, he will not be on a prolonged state of illness.&nbsp;</span><br></p><p>\n</p><p><b>Female Natives\n</b></p><p><span style=\"font-size: 1rem;\">Females born in this Nakshatra will also enjoy more or less the same results mentioned above.&nbsp;</span><br></p><p><br></p><p>1. Physical features: Handsome and ever sweet seventeen i.e. she will look very young even while she crosses her forty. An inviting appearance with thick lips. In some cases, ugly appearance due to teeth protruding outside the lips have been noticed.\n</p><p><span style=\"font-size: 1rem;\">2. Character and general events: She has great aspirations in life and is a spendthrift. A modest and liberal disposition. She has sympathy towards the weak. As in the case of Shravana born, she is an enforcement master. She should curb this tendency for a congenial atmosphere in the home front.&nbsp;</span><br></p><p><span style=\"font-size: 1rem;\">3. Education, sources of earning/profession: Mixed nature of talents have been noticed in the field of education. Some are interested in literature and some in sciences.

The entire span of this Nakshatra falls in the sign Kumbha (Aquarius), from 6°40' to 20°00'. People born in this Nakshatra have the appearance of a well-to-do person. But they are very simple, principled people living a simple, straightforward life. They have a good memory and a tendency to remember all the bad experiences.\n</p><p><span style=\"font-size: 1rem;\">While the male born in this Nakshatra are generally abase, the females are tall and thin, with a matured expression on their face. Both male as well as female natives born in this Nakshatra are very religious and god-fearing.&nbsp;</span><br></p><p><span style=\"font-size: 1rem;\">When the lord of the Nakshatra, Rahu, is in a fixed sign, the native tends to have an adamant nature. But this rigid attitude on the part of the native is often for some selfless cause, which has the potential to benefit the society at large. Because of their uncompromising nature when it comes to following the principles, these people have to face difficulties in their personal as well as professional lives in the early part of their life. But as the middle age dawns and they mature, they know how to have their own way without getting hurt in the process.&nbsp;</span><br></p><p><span style=\"font-size: 1rem;\">This sign, Kumbha (Aquarius), itself is a sign indicating a research-oriented mindset. Hence a Shatabhishaka born is ideally suited for any scientific career or a research job.&nbsp;</span><br></p><p><span style=\"font-size: 1rem;\">A badly aspected third house in the chart of the native generally indicates trouble form his/her younger brother/sister. These people have to help their relatives often. But the same generosity is seldom reciprocated. Similarly, a badly aspected 7th house and Shukra (Venus) in a Shatabhishaka born chart indicates a troubled married life.&nbsp;</span><br></p><p><span style=\"font-size: 1rem;\">Though well to do in appearance, the health of these people is often weak. They tend to suffer from diabetics, obesity and cold.&nbsp;</span><br></p><p>\n</p><p><b>Male Natives\n</b></p><p><span style=\"font-size: 1rem;\">1. Physical features: He will have a soft body, excellent memory power, wide forehead, attractive eyes, bright countenance, prominent nose and bulged abdomen. He would appear to belong to a aristocratic family at the first sight itself.&nbsp;</span><br></p><p><span style=\"font-size: 1rem;\">2. Character and general events: He is of the type \"Satyameva Jayate\". He will not hesitate to sacrifice his own life for upholding the truth. As he is born with certain principles, he has to quite often confront with others as he cannot deviate from his principles of life. Selfless service is his motto. He insists on following the religious traditions. He is also of the adamant type. Once he takes a decision it is not easy for others to change his decision. While he is very intelligent and efficient in most of the walks of life, he is very soft in his heart. He is the mixture of good and bad.&nbsp;</span><br></p><p><span style=\"font-size: 1rem;\">When he is provoked, he will rise like a bulldog, but that anger is soon subsided. As he does not believe in pomp and show, he has a feeling of shyness to exhibit his talents. However, his talents will be unearthed due to his interesting and attractive conversation, which will be highly instructive and educative.&nbsp;</span><br></p><p><span style=\"font-size: 1rem;\">3. Education, sources of income/profession: Period up-to 34 years of age will be a trial some period in his profession field. Period after 34 years will be the period of constant progress. He is highly suited for the practice of astrology, psychology and healing arts. His literary capacity and greatness will come to limelight even when he is very young. He is capable of acquiring very fine and high education. This Nakshatra has produced eminent doctors and research fellows in medicines.&nbsp;</span><br></p><p><span style=\"font-size: 1rem;\">4. Family life: Generally he has to face a lot of problems from his dear and near ones. Even then, he always extents his helping hand to his near and dears even without asking for such help. It has been noticed that native has to undergo maximum mental agony due to his brothers. He cannot also enjoy much benefit from his father, whereas full love and affection is derived from his mother.&nbsp;</span><br></p><p><span style=\"font-size: 1rem;\">It has also been found that he is not capable of leading a happy married life. In some cases, when there is severe affliction of Saturn and Jupiter, it has been found that the native remains a chronic bachelor throughout his life. While on the one hand he does not enjoy happy married life, his wife will have all the good qualities that are expected of a companion.&nbsp;</span><br></p><p><span style=\"font-size: 1rem;\">5. Health: Outwardly he may appear to have very good health but it is not like that. He cannot tolerate even the slightest affliction to the body. He is prone to urinary diseases, breathing trouble and diabetics. As he is too much inclined in the sexual pleasures, he may have sexually transmitted diseases. Even though he may keep illicit relationship with other females it will be kept a secret from all. He may have problems with his jaws. He is also liable to suffer from colic troubles and must take precautions to protect himself from the diseases incidental to exposure to cold weather.&nbsp;</span><br></p><p>\n</p><p><b>Female Natives\n</b></p><p><span style=\"font-size: 1rem;\">1.

The natives here are more mentally aggressive than physically aggressive. Here the focus of the natives will be on controlling their temper and aggression, mustering the will-power to achieve their goals.&nbsp;</span><br></p><p><i>2nd Pada:</i> The second pada of the Purva Bhadrapada Nakshatra falls in the Taurus Navamsa ruled by Venus.

Here the focus is on communication, and the native is curious. Here they express the lighter aspects of their nature, such as a sense of humour.\n</p><p><i>4th Pada: </i>The fourth pada of the Purva Bhadrapada Nakshatra falls in the Cancer Navamsa ruled by the Moon. Here the focus of the natives can be too dangerous, as they manifest the aspects of both the persecutor and persecuted. These natives are compatible with the natives of the other three padas.</p><p><br></p><p><b><span style=\"font-size: 1rem;\">Other aspects of this Nakshatra:&nbsp;</span><br><span style=\"font-size: 1rem;\"></span></b></p><p>The Purushartha (life's vector or motivation) is Artha. \n</p><p>Totem animal is Lion (male). \n</p><p>Symbol - a sword. \n</p><p>Devata (Deity) - Aja Ekapada. \n</p><p>Dosha - Vata.\n</p><p>\n</p><p>This Nakshatra spans from 20°0' in Kumbha (Aquarius) to 3°20' in Meena (Pisces). While the first three quarters of this Nakshatra fall in the sign Kumbha (Aquarius), the last Nakshatra falls in the sign Meena (Pisces). While Shani (Saturn) rules Kumbha (Aquarius), Guru (Jupiter) rules Meena (Pisces) and the Nakshatra Poorva Bhadrapada is ruled by Guru (Jupiter). Hence the outcome is the end result of a combination of all these 3 planets, depending on the quarter of the Nakshatra.\n</p><p><span style=\"font-size: 1rem;\">A person born in the first three quarters of this Nakshatra (natal sign being Kumbha (Aquarius) has a slender, tall stature. Thee natives born in the last quarter (natal sign being Meena (Pisces)) have medium height with somewhat fleshy physique. For those born in the Meena (Pisces), a well placed Guru (Jupiter) indicates good fortune, but for those who are born in the sign Kumbha (Aquarius), even a well placed Shani (Saturn), the lord of Kumbha (Aquarius) means that the person has to put in reasonable efforts to get his share of the fortune. Poorva Bhadrapada born have set principles in their life, which they like to follow under any circumstances.&nbsp;</span><br></p><p><span style=\"font-size: 1rem;\">These people like to help others, and can render impartial advice, which helps them earn the respect and confidence of others. Making money is not the first thing in their mind and hence they may be financially weak. But what matters the most for them is the position they achieve in the society, through helping others and following their own set of principles. Also they spend money in the most proper way, avoiding any misuse of the same.&nbsp;</span><br></p><p><span style=\"font-size: 1rem;\">Poorva Bhadrapada born tend to suffer from acidity arising out of mental tension and diabetes.&nbsp;</span><br></p><p><span style=\"font-size: 1rem;\">Females born in this Nakshatra have a well-balanced body. They are a little more practical minded when it comes to charity.&nbsp;</span><br></p><p>\n</p><p><b>Male Natives\n</b></p><p><span style=\"font-size: 1rem;\">1. Physical features: One of the peculiar body phenomena is that he has a lifted ankle of the foot. He is of medium size. Broad cheeks with flushy lips.&nbsp;</span><br></p><p><span style=\"font-size: 1rem;\">2. Character and general events: He is generally a peace loving person but occasional blasting has also been noticed. He is a very simpleton type. Since he is very much principled, he has to suffer a lot mentally as he takes into his heart even a small confrontation or problem. He likes good food and is a voracious eater. He is not very particular about dresses.&nbsp;</span><br></p><p><span style=\"font-size: 1rem;\">He normally expresses impartial opinion. He does not believe in the blind principles of religion. He is ever ready to lend a helping hand to the needy. Even so, hatred and resistance will be his reward in return. He can easily enjoy the respects and confidence of others even if he is financially weak. He is God fearing and performs religious rites in accordance with the scriptures. While the native will be moderately rich, he likes to have respect and honor from the public rather than accumulating money. He is impartial in expressing his views.&nbsp;</span><br></p><p><span style=\"font-size: 1rem;\">3. Education, sources of earnings / profession: As he is a born intelligent and has the knack of trade he can shine in any type of job he undertakes. If he is employed in a government organization he can look forward for unexpected gains or promotions from the government. He is capable of quite independent life both socially and financially. Period between 24 and 33 years of age will mark remarkable all-round progress in his life. Even though occasional mental tension is not ruled out during this period. Period between 40 years and 54 years of age will be his golden period when he can establish fully. He keeps much restriction on the spending activities.&nbsp;</span><br></p><p><span style=\"font-size: 1rem;\">He can shine in the field of business, banking, government job, or as a teacher, actor or writer, research worker and astrologer or astronomer. If in government service, most of the Poorva Bhadrapada born are engaged in the revenue collection department or in any capacity where cash transactions take place.&nbsp;</span><br></p><p><span style=\"font-size: 1rem;\">4. Family life: He cannot enjoy fully the love and affection from his mother. As per the learned in astrology, the native will cause death or separation of his mother early. But in my personal experience, the native cannot derive full love and attention of his mother, as she will be working. Naturally, being a working mother, she is away most of the time and the native is automatically separated. Hence our ancients who have written this dictum are also correct to the extent of separation, but not to the extent of death. For causing death other planetary affliction is also necessary and birth in this Nakshatra alone is not sufficient.&nbsp;</span><br></p><p><span style=\"font-size: 1rem;\">One of the redeeming features is that there will be a lot of things with which he can be proud of his father. Subject to other favorable planetary positions, father of the native has been found to have fame and possess a very good moral character. Such popularity may be mainly in the field of fine arts, oration or in the writing field. In spite of these good qualities of his father, the native quite often disagree with the opinion and confrontation takes place.&nbsp;</span><br></p><p>\n5<span style=\"font-size: 1rem;\">. Health: He is prone to paralytic attack, acidity and diabetes. He may have problems with the ribs, flanks and soles of the feet.&nbsp;</span></p><p>\n</p><p><b><span style=\"font-size: 1rem;\">Female Natives&nbsp;</span><br></b></p><p><span style=\"font-size: 1rem;\">Females born in this Nakshatra will also enjoy more or less the same results as mentioned above in addition to the results mentioned below:&nbsp;</span><br></p><p>\n</p><p>1. Physical features: She is neither lean nor fatty, and neither tall nor short. In some cases very slim figure have also been noticed. However, she is very beautiful in appearance.\n</p><p><span style=\"font-size: 1rem;\">2. Character and general events: Honesty and sincerity are the main characteristics of this native. She is of the type who believes that let her head is cut down, she will not deviate from the right path and principles. She is a born leader. She is capable of extracting work from others. Hence she will be successful when she gets power and authority. Example of extreme optimism.&nbsp;</span><br></p><p><span style=\"font-size: 1rem;\">While she has the humanitarian doctrine, she will not extend her helping hand unless she is convinced fully that such kindness, sympathy and generosity are actually required. There is a peculiar politeness in her behavior.&nbsp;</span><br></p><p><span style=\"font-size: 1rem;\">3. Education, sources of earnings / profession: Her education will be in the scientific or technical field. Hence the native is earmarked for the profession of teacher, statistician, astrologer or research worker.&nbsp;</span><br></p><p><span style=\"font-size: 1rem;\">4. Family life: She will have more attachment towards her husband and will be blessed with children. She has good ability in the house hold administration. She will enjoy lots of benefits from her children. She will have many children if she marries a Rohini boy.&nbsp;</span><br></p><p><span style=\"font-size: 1rem;\">5. Health: She is prone to low blood pressure, dropsy or swollen ankles, apoplexy and palpitation. Perspiring feet and enlarged liver.</span></p><p>\n            </p></div>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n</section>",

He has the basic qualities to be a good collector of people, treating all as equal irrespective of their social status. He is a short-tempered person, but never likes to trouble others. A strong Guru (Jupiter) with a weak Shani (Saturn) in  horoscope indicates that all the positive aspects of personality are highlighted.&nbsp;</span><br></p><p><span style=\"font-size: 1rem;\">When the dual character of this sign is dominant, i.e. when the lord of sign, Guru (Jupiter), as well as the lord of the Nakshatra, Shani (Saturn) are placed in a duel sign, the native tends to undertake many assignments at the same time. These people also master many subjects simultaneously. In case of the natives who do not get the chance to get an official certificate of being educated, they posses reasonably good knowledge of any subject. These people are the real believers in the power of knowledge.&nbsp;</span><br></p><p>\nB<span style=\"font-size: 1rem;\">ecause of their quest for knowledge, these people, even when they start form the lowest rung of the organizational chart, successfully rise to head their respective sections or even the organizations.

It is ruled by the planet Buddha (Mercury), the planet of intelligence. This Nakshatra comes in the last sign of the zodiac, Meena (Pisces), which is ruled by the planet Guru (Jupiter). Guru (Jupiter) and Buddha (Mercury) belong to different groups of planets. As a result, a Revati born shows a mix of the qualities shown by both these planets.\n</p><p><span style=\"font-size: 1rem;\">A person born in the Revati Nakshatra is healthy with a moderate height. But the disease resisting capacity of the person will depend on the individual placement of planets giving vitality and energy, i.e. the planets Mangala (Mars) and Sūrya (Sun). Though somewhat short tempered, these people are pure-hearted. It is very difficult to make them accept the view, which does not suit their principles in life. If Buddha (Mercury) is placed in a dual sign, these people are quick to jump at conclusions. They are god fearing and follow the principles of their religion.&nbsp;</span><br></p><p><span style=\"font-size: 1rem;\">Their professions also show the characters of Guru (Jupiter) and Buddha (Mercury). Scientific inquiry and thinking and planning on a large scale are inherent in any activity undertaken by these people. Strong Buddha (Mercury) in the horoscope of these people may make an excellent mathematician or an astrologer. A strong Guru (Jupiter) may make a good historian or an archeologist. Generally these people settle in a place far away from their birthplace. But these people have to depend on their own efforts to make progress in life. It is difficult to gain more than their efforts in any undertaking.&nbsp;</span><br></p><p>\nT<span style=\"font-size: 1rem;\">hese people seldom receive help form their relatives, even from the close family members. But the spouse is an exception, especially in case of people with a good Shukra (Venus) in their chart.&nbsp;</span></p><p>\n<span style=\"font-size: 1rem;\">Females born in this Nakshatra are as a rule, beautiful.

Feelings run high when ardent Aries is around. You go all out for what you want - no sitting around waiting for others to make the first move. What you like is short, sharp sex. The basic Aries energy is rapacious, self-oriented, and self-confident. When you finally fall in love, rather than in lust, the romantic and somewhat naive side of your fire nature emerges, but you will remain headstrong and passionate. No matter how romantically inclined, Aries passion is indissolubly linked to love, so you want to express your feelings in a very direct way.</span></div><div>\n</div><div><br></div><br><div><b>Taurus :&nbsp;</b><span style=\"font-size: 1.5rem;\">By far the most sensual of the signs, Taurus has a passionate nature and a strong sex drive. You are turned on by beautiful people and places. Your earthy, solid body exudes sensuality and arouses desire, but you hesitate to move in on a prospective lover, preferring to be asked. Despite a strong libido, you are not driven by lust. You like a stable, orderly life and are renowned for possessiveness; an active sex life is usually part of an ongoing partnership. When you fall in love, you fall heavily and finally. You are committed for life. Love is something Taurus takes very seriously indeed.</span></div><div>\n</div><div><br></div><br><div><b>Gemini :&nbsp;</b><span style=\"font-size: 1.5rem;\">A restless seeker after new sensations, Gemini never stays still. You dance with partner after partner in an intricate sexual gavotte. Your urge for communication demands continual movement for you, sex is an intellectual activity. You may like to discuss feelings, but you don't feel a need for them. One of your greatest problems in relationships is understanding how other people feel. Indeed, you can be so insensitive to people's feelings that you unthinkingly dash their hopes of love without even noticing. To overcome this, you need to listen as well as talk. Gemini values friendship over love.</span></div><div>\n</div><div><br></div><br><div><b>Cancer : </b>It<span style=\"font-size: 1.5rem;\">&nbsp;is the sign with a powerful urge to nurture people. Your sexual style is caring, concerned, and oriented towards sharing. You feel a need to take care of your partner. Yours is a sentimental, romantic sign. When you fall in love you want the full works: hearts, flowers, and a huge wedding. In love, your biggest problem is over-sensitivity. You are jealous and possessive. You want your partner's undivided love because it makes you feel secure. As a tactile sign, you enjoy kissing and cuddling. Snuggling up with the one you love makes you feel good. Cancer is a great holder of hands.</span></div><div>\n</div><div><br></div><br><div><b>Leo :&nbsp;</b><span style=\"font-size: 1.5rem;\">The natural king of the zodiac, Leo loves to be the center of attention and to be in love - which is not difficult since you are ruled by the sun and have a warm-hearted nature. As a fire sign, you are exceedingly passionate and sexually demanding. You are a confident and self-assured lover. People do tend to notice you. You are dramatic and full of vitality and bounce, like a boisterous lion cub. But, unlike a cub, you radiate an irresistible sexual power that draws everyone into fascinated orbit around you.</span></div><div>\n</div><div><br></div><br><div><b>Virgo&nbsp;</b><span style=\"font-size: 1.5rem;\">: On the surface, meticulous Virgo is a shy sign, but you are an entertaining companion for those who take the trouble to inquire into your deeper self in your search for perfection. You tend not to pursue the object of your desire openly. Given the right partner, you display an earthy sensuality and a strong carnal appetite. You are not a sign that gets carried away by love and sentiment. You are much too practical and analytical for that. But when you do fall in love, you are thoughtful and caring and will do all you can to serve your partner.</span></div><div>\n</div><div><br></div><br><div><b>Libra&nbsp;</b><span style=\"font-size: 1.5rem;\">: You need a partner to make yourself complete. For you, togetherness is what life is all about. You delight in pleasing people and because you adjust to the needs of others, your relationships are always harmonious. You are blessed with enormous charm and sexual charisma, and you don't hesitate to use it to get what you want. Libra is a sign much given to sentiment and romanticism. You do all you can to make your partner happy. You are an accomplished lover and adept at pleasing your partner. Libra is a very refined sign and has very discriminating tastes. You enjoy the finer things in life and this applies to your sexual encounters as well. Everything surrounding sex must be beautiful and harmonious. You like subtle perfumes, candles, incense, massage oils. They arouse your senses. You also like soft, sensual fabrics.</span></div><div>\n</div><br><br><div><b>Scorpio :&nbsp;</b><span style=\"font-size: 1.5rem;\">You are a sophisticated and highly adept lover. Scorpio rules sex, birth, death, and rebirth. You have an urge to explore dark places of life where others fear to tread. Powerfully libidinous and intensely sexy, you ignore taboos. You see sex as an opportunity to explore the mystical depths of emotion. Scorpio is a compulsive and obsessive sign. When you are in lust, you obsess about the object of your desires. When you are in love, you think about your beloved constantly. Love, lust, and libido are all important to you. You do not fall in love easily. But when you do fall, you fall hard. And you stay there. What you seek is a true soulmate. Your world is emotional, dramatic, tense, full of emotional undercurrents and the echoes of painful traumas from the past.</span></div><div>\n</div><br><br><div><b>Sagittarius :&nbsp;</b><span style=\"font-size: 1.5rem;\">Freedom-loving Sagittarius is a natural philanderer who hates to be tied down for too long. Ever-impetuous, you revel in a spontaneous, inflammatory sexual adventure with plenty of passion. You fall in love easily. Half the time it is infatuation, but you don't mind and you rarely differentiate between the two until the affair is over. You enjoy being in love. You are an unemotional sign who does not agonize over the future; you simply enjoy what is happening now with great verve and passion. One of your difficulties in love is that you always want more. You have a nagging feeling there could be something more exciting around the corner. It takes a strong love to hold you, but once committed, you are usually faithful.</span></div><div>\n</div><div><br></div><br><div><b>Capricorn :&nbsp;</b><span style=\"font-size: 1.5rem;\">Despite having an earthy sensuality, Capricorns can be cautious when it comes to carnal passion. You prefer to wait for the right partner. You take love seriously. You are at your most sober when young, but as you mature the lecherous goat emerges who impulsively climbs the mountain of desire. Capricorn falls in love slowly. The attraction strengthens, the mutual trust develops, and eventually you realize you are deeply in love. Once the commitment has been made, you have an unshakable loyalty to your lover. You find difficulty in openly showing affection. Sex is fine; you can let yourself go within a committed relationship. But it is in the everyday expression of affection that you can be inhibited.</span></div><div>\n</div><br><br><div><b>Aquarius :&nbsp;</b><span style=\"font-size: 1.5rem;\">As an Aquarius, you value your independence highly and like to do things in your own unique style. Many of your sexual encounters take place somewhere in your head. Although you are interested in humanity as a whole, when it comes to one-on-one closeups, you are often at a loss. Love is something of a puzzle to you. Aquarius likes the thought of a soulmate. Someone with whom you fit, someone who makes your life perfect. Eventually, of course, you find out that soulmates are not always like this. But by then you are so deeply in love it doesn't matter anyway. When you are deeply committed, you are faithful and loyal.</span></div><div>\n</div><div><br></div><br><div><b>Pisces :&nbsp;</b><span style=\"font-size: 1.5rem;\">A Pisces in love is lost in an ecstatic dream. And, since love and sex are one and the same for Pisces, sex is a beautiful fantasy you want to merge and blend with your partner, to become one. Seductive and romantic, your fluid nature sees no boundary between yourself and your beloved. But, all too often, the dream turns out to be merely an illusion. Each time you fall in love you believe you have found your soulmate. You give yourself body and soul to your beloved. Dreams, however, can easily turn into nightmares when you finally realize that all is not what it seemed and the illusion is shattered. You tend to live an \"if only\" life, dreaming endlessly of what might be and fantasizing about the perfect love affair. Not surprisingly, everyday life usually fails to measure up to your dream world, and the relationships you enter into with such hope fail to fulfill the fantastic promise that they hold in your mind. Pisces has a tendency to cling to the past, and to lovers, and never really severs the bonds. There is nothing Pisces loves more than to see an old flame and rekindle the passion, at least for a time. The thought of hurting anyone's feelings, especially someone you have loved, is more than you can bear.</span></div><div>\n</div><div><br></div></div>\n            <hr class=\"line\" mbr-style=\"{'width': lineLength + '%'}\">\n        </div>\n    </div>\n</section>",
