</strong></p><p><em>3°20" to 16°40" Pisces (Meena)
</em></p><p><strong><br></strong></p><p><strong>The four quarters are ruled by: 
</strong></p><p><em>1st Pada: </em>The first pada of the Uttara Bhadrapada Nakshatra falls in the Leo Navamsa ruled by the Sun. Here the natives are proud, knowledgeable and goal-oriented. The focus here is on spreading the sunshine of experience.

</p><p><em>3rd Pada:</em> The third pada of the Uttara Bhadrapada Nakshatra falls in the Libra Navamsa ruled by Venus. The focus here is on being grounded and balanced. The natives’ orientation is objective.
</p><p><em>4th Pada:</em> The fourth pada of the Uttara Bhadrapada Nakshatra falls in the Scorpio Navamsa ruled by Mars. The focus here is on the occult and mysterious, from which the native gains great wisdom.</p><p><br></p><p><strong><span style="font-size: 1rem;">Other aspects of this Nakshatra:&nbsp;</span><br><span style="font-size: 1rem;"></span></strong></p><p>The Purushardha (life's vector or motivation) is Kama. 
</p><p>Totem animal is Cow (female). 
</p><p>Symbol - two people standing back to back or 2 legs at the back of funeral bed.

</p><p>This Nakshatra spans from 3°20' to 16°40' in Meena (Pisces). While the wise planet Guru (Jupiter) rules this sign, the planet of patience, Shani (Saturn), rules the Nakshatra.
</p><p><span style="font-size: 1rem;">A male born in this sign is somewhat an innocent looking person, yet quite intelligent when it comes to business. He has the basic qualities to be a good collector of people, treating all as equal irrespective of their social status. He is a short-tempered person, but never likes to trouble others. A strong Guru (Jupiter) with a weak Shani (Saturn) in  horoscope indicates that all the positive aspects of personality are highlighted.&nbsp;</span><br></p><p><span style="font-size: 1rem;">When the dual character of this sign is dominant, i.e. when the lord of sign, Guru (Jupiter), as well as the lord of the Nakshatra, Shani (Saturn) are placed in a duel sign, the native tends to undertake many assignments at the same time. These people also master many subjects simultaneously. In case of the natives who do not get the chance to get an official certificate of being educated, they posses reasonably good knowledge of any subject. These people are the real believers in the power of knowledge.&nbsp;</span><br></p><p>
B<span style="font-size: 1rem;">ecause of their quest for knowledge, these people, even when they start form the lowest rung of the organizational chart, successfully rise to head their respective sections or even the organizations. These people are extremely versatile and do not like to spend their time idly. They tend to make a fortune at a place far away from their place of birth.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 1rem;">They enjoy good family life, but the second house in their chart needs to be properly aspected. They get the respect of their family members. These people are prone to suffer from mildly painful and yet not very dangerous problems like piles and fissures, hernia.&nbsp;</span><br></p><p><span style="font-size: 1rem;">The females born in this Nakshatra have a stout physique and are prone to put on weight. They are charming, caring towards their family members and know how to manage the affairs of their house. They are adaptable; know how to carry on even in some of the most adverse circumstances.&nbsp;</span><br></p><p>
</p><p><strong>Male Natives
</strong></p><p><span style="font-size: 1rem;">1. Physical features: Most attractive and innocent looking person. There is an inherent magnetically force in his look. If he looks at a person with a mild smile, rest assure, that person will be his slave.&nbsp;</span><br></p><p><span style="font-size: 1rem;">2. Character and general events: He keeps equal relationship with high and low people i.e. irrespective of the status of the person. He has a spot-less heart. He does not like to give troubles to others. The only drawback noticed in this native in the behavioral field is that temper is always on the tip of his nose. However, such short-temper is not of a permanent nature. He will not hesitate to sacrifice even his life to those who love him. At the same time once he is hurt he will become a lion. He has wisdom, knowledge, and personality.&nbsp;</span><br></p><p><span style="font-size: 1rem;">He is expert in delivering attractive speeches.

Laziness is a remote question for him. Once he opts to undertake a job he cannot turn back till that job is completed. Even in the case of utter failure he is not desperate. If he is employed he will reach to the top. In most of the cases it has been noticed that even if this Nakshatra born persons are employed initially in the lower or middle level positions, they later on reach to a good position and they always receive reward and praise from others.&nbsp;</span><br></p><p><span style="font-size: 1rem;">It has been noticed that his stability in life or even the slightest upward movement begins after his marriage. He starts his livelihood at a very young age say 18 or 19 years of age. He will have important changes in the professional field at his 19th, 21st, 28th, 30th, 35th and 42nd years.&nbsp;</span><br></p><p><span style="font-size: 1rem;">4. Family life: While he keeps praising his father on the one side due to the prominent personality and religious rigidity of his father, he cannot virtually derive any benefit from his father. He leads a neglected childhood. He is normally subjected to a life away from his home town.&nbsp;</span><br></p><p><span style="font-size: 1rem;">His married life will be full of happiness. He will be blessed to have a most suitable wife. His children also will be an asset, most obedient, understanding and respecting children. He will be blessed with grandchildren also. He is an ornament in his family.&nbsp;</span><br></p><p><span style="font-size: 1rem;">5. Health: His health will be very good. He is non-care about his own health.

When all these three essentials required for the present day are combined in one, what more I can describe or attribute to her character.&nbsp;</span><br></p><p><span style="font-size: 1rem;">3. Education, sources of earning/profession: Employed females can attain good positions due to their own effort. She is best suited to the profession of a lawyer or arbitrator.
