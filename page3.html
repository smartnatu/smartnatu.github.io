</div><div>Totem animal is Horse (male).

</div><div><strong>
</strong></div><div><em><br></em></div><div><em>Ashwini</em> is the first Nakshatra of zodiac having a spread from 0°0' to 13°20' and ruled by the Southern node Ketu. Entire Ashwini Nakshatra falls in the Mesha (Aries), which is ruled by the aggressive and fiery planet Mars (Mangala). Though generally the qualities like aggressiveness are prominent in natives born in this sign (Rashi) and Nakshatra, the occurrence of the same may differ according to the quarter occupied by the Chandra (Moon) and the sign occupied by the lord of the Nakshatra, Ketu.
</div><div>
</div><div><br></div><div>Males born in this Nakshatra have large eyes and a broad forehead. The nose is slightly bigger and longer compared to the rest of the face. Generally these people are slim but yet powerful. If any of the fiery planets, viz. The Sūrya (Sun) or Mangala (Mars) is placed in any of the fiery signs, viz. Mesha (Aries), Simha (Leo) or Dhanu (Sagittarius), these people have good disease resistant power.
</div><div>
</div><div><br></div><div>People born in Ashwini are generally cheerful, nearly always bubbling with enthusiasm. They are very active, always busy doing something and if nothing else, will spend their time keeping their house neat and clean.
</div><div>
</div><div>They are faithful to the people who love them and will try to do anything for such people to reciprocate their love. But understanding somewhat rude and strange behavior of Ashwini natives will be the responsibility of others. If the others can do this, then Ashwini native will prove to be the best friend one can find. Ashwini natives are sympathetic to the people in trouble and can provide proper guidance to such people.
</div><div>
</div><div><br></div><div>Though aggressive and rude in normal times, males and females born in this Nakshatra know how to keep their patience in times of difficulty. For this reason, males born in this Nakshatra make some of the best military officers. But it is very difficult to calm these people when they loose their cool.
</div><div>
</div><div><br></div><div>These people are stubborn and whenever provoked, will try to avenge their insult. This quality is most prominent in case of people having strong Mars (Mangala). If Ketu, lord of Ashwini is occupying Vrshchika, such person will have the tendency to take revenge secretly.
</div><div>
</div><div>They meticulously plan their tasks and consider nearly every aspect of the issue before taking any action. They are ready to accept the responsibility of their actions, whether good or bad.
</div><div>
</div><div><br></div><div>A male born in this Nakshatra is a firm believer in God and respects holy places. But he also carries the view that religion is not an end in itself; rather, it is a tool for humankind to achieve happiness. Hence, he also believes that a religion needs to keep on adapting to modern times. A female born under this Nakshatra tries to stick to old traditions while carrying a modern mindset. She likes to respect the old and elderly and perform the traditional family rituals.
</div><div>
</div><div>Ashwini natives are a jack of all trades. In their quest to know as many new things as possible, they end up trying various vocations, rarely carrying on a single vocation for a longer period. </div><div><br></div><div>Generally they have to struggle for success even in small matters till the 30th year.
</div><div>
</div><div>The wise old saying 'Marry in haste and repent at leisure' fits perfectly to these people. Though they sincerely love their family members and close associates, their somewhat rude behavior sometimes alienates them. When that happens, these people feel rejected. Many times they receive help and appreciation from people outside their family.
