</strong></p><div><strong>
</strong></div><div><strong>The four quarters are ruled by:</strong> 
</div><div><em>1st Pada:</em> The first pada of native born in the Bharani Nakshtra comes in the Leo Navamsa, ruled by the Sun. The significant thing about this pada is that the native is totally absorbed in creativity. These people can be very selfish and hurt others unknowingly.
</div><div><br></div><div><em>2nd Pada:</em> The second pada of the native born in the Bharani Nakshtra is in the Virgo Navamsam and is governed by Mercury. The focus is on hard-work. The person born in this pada is likely to be altruistic. The native knows what exactly he is doing even with chaos reigning all around him.
</div><div><br></div><div><em>3rd Pada: </em>The third pada of the native born in the Bharani Nakshtra falls in the Libra Navamsa, governed by Venus. These natives have the special skill to harmonize opposites. However, there is likely to be too much sex that this native will indulge in, and whether it is good or bad for him/her depends on how mature the native is.
</div><div><br></div><div><em>4th Pada:</em>The fourth pada of the native born in the Bharani Nakshtra falls in the Scorpio Sun Sign Navamsa, governed by Mars. The native will be brimming with energy, and they can be extremely productive, and may even come up with some valuable discovery. The native must, however, ensure that the excess energy is utilized in a non-destructive and judicious way.</div><div>
</div><div><strong><br></strong></div><div><strong>Other aspects of this Nakshatra:
</strong></div><div>The Purushardha (life's vector or motivation) is Artha. 
</div><div>Totem animal is Elephant (female). 
</div><div>Symbol - Yoni (female sexual organ). 
</div><div>Devata (Deity) - Yama. 
</div><div>Dosha - Pitta.
</div><div>
</div><div><br></div><div>This is the second Nakshatra of zodiac, ranging from 13째20' to 26째40'. The planet of art and beauty, Shukra (Venus), rules this Nakshatra. People born in this Nakshatra are generally harmless creatures. This is in stark contrast to Ashwini and Krittika natives, who are aggressive to the core. Bharani born are honest. They are frank in their opinions and do not want to modify their opinions to please others. They like to work by principles, because of which they have to face some difficulties in life.
</div><div>
</div><div><em><br></em></div><div><em>Bharani</em> born have a medium build and scanty hair, with a large forehead. Just like an ox, these people have a head that is broad at the temples and narrow at the chin.
</div><div>
</div><div>Since changing the mindset is something really against their nature, they do not pay much attention to views and opinions contrary to their own. But the same steady mind and fixed views enables them to get to the core of any problem.
</div><div>
</div><div><br></div><div>They like to achieve supremacy of any group and be the leader. They have to face many hurdles in their path and often face failure. Because it is in their nature to try to have their own way, they stand to loose the support of their followers and well wishers.
</div><div>
</div><div><br></div><div>An interesting feature of those born in Bharani is that they are quiet fond of spreading rumors. This is especially true when Buddha (Mercury) is aspected by Shani (Saturn).
</div><div>
</div><div>Their all round knowledge enables them to work in nearly any field. Arts, entertainment and ways and means of enjoying material pleasure give them their fixed stream of income. Surgery, especially plastic surgery is also a good career option.
</div><div>
</div><div><br></div><div>These people are normally happy in their marital relations. Their life partners take good care of household duties. These people love their families and do not like to live away from their families. These people are prone to suffer from diabetes and teeth problems.
</div><div>
</div><div>Females born in this Nakshatra are career minded. But they are seldom found occupying senior positions. In house, they act more like a leader of a group, rather than an ordinary family member. Because of their overconfident nature, these females tend to respect and obey only those people who are really superior to them.
