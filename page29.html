</em></p><p><br></p><p><strong>The four quarters are ruled by: &nbsp;</strong><br></p><p><em>1st Pada: </em>The first pada of the Revati Nakshatra falls in the Sagittarius sun sign Navamsa ruled by Jupiter. Here the focus of the natives is on being casual and generous. Natives will be very optimistic.
</p><p><em>2nd Pada:</em> The second pada of the Revati Nakshatra falls in the Capricorn Navamsa ruled by Saturn. Here the focus of the native is on being well-organized, and sticking to the tried and tested path, without taking any risks.
</p><p><em>3rd Pada:</em> The third pada of the Revati Nakshatra falls in the Aquarius Navamsa ruled by Saturn. Here the focus is on being compassionate and sensitive to the pains of others, and do everything to help them.
</p><p><em>4th Pada:</em> The fourth pada of the Revati Nakshatra falls in the Pisces Navamsa ruled by Jupiter. Here the native is prone to dreaming, and building castles in the air. The native here is also easily influenced.</p><p><br></p><p><strong><span style="font-size: 1rem;">Other aspects of this Nakshatra:&nbsp;</span><br><span style="font-size: 1rem;"></span></strong></p><p>The Purushardha (life's vector or motivation) is Moksha. 
</p><p>Totem animal is Elephant (female). 
</p><p>Symbol - a fish. 
</p><p>Devata (Deity) - Pushan. 
</p><p>Dosha - Kapha.
</p><p>
</p><p>This is the last Nakshatra of the zodiac, spanning from 16°40' minutes to 30°00' in Meena (Pisces). It is ruled by the planet Buddha (Mercury), the planet of intelligence. This Nakshatra comes in the last sign of the zodiac, Meena (Pisces), which is ruled by the planet Guru (Jupiter). Guru (Jupiter) and Buddha (Mercury) belong to different groups of planets. As a result, a Revati born shows a mix of the qualities shown by both these planets.
</p><p><span style="font-size: 1rem;">A person born in the Revati Nakshatra is healthy with a moderate height. But the disease resisting capacity of the person will depend on the individual placement of planets giving vitality and energy, i.e. the planets Mangala (Mars) and Sūrya (Sun). Though somewhat short tempered, these people are pure-hearted. It is very difficult to make them accept the view, which does not suit their principles in life. If Buddha (Mercury) is placed in a dual sign, these people are quick to jump at conclusions. They are god fearing and follow the principles of their religion.&nbsp;</span><br></p><p><span style="font-size: 1rem;">Their professions also show the characters of Guru (Jupiter) and Buddha (Mercury). Scientific inquiry and thinking and planning on a large scale are inherent in any activity undertaken by these people. Strong Buddha (Mercury) in the horoscope of these people may make an excellent mathematician or an astrologer. A strong Guru (Jupiter) may make a good historian or an archeologist. Generally these people settle in a place far away from their birthplace. But these people have to depend on their own efforts to make progress in life. It is difficult to gain more than their efforts in any undertaking.&nbsp;</span><br></p><p>
T<span style="font-size: 1rem;">hese people seldom receive help form their relatives, even from the close family members. But the spouse is an exception, especially in case of people with a good Shukra (Venus) in their chart.&nbsp;</span></p><p>
<span style="font-size: 1rem;">Females born in this Nakshatra are as a rule, beautiful. But they are stubborn and authoritative. They are also good at jobs that require repetitive skills.&nbsp;</span></p><p>
