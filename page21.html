</p><p><br></p><p><strong>The four quarters are ruled by: 
</strong></p><p><em>1st Pada: </em>The first pada of the Moola Nakshatra falls in the Aries Navamsa ruled by Mars. This quarter is associated with all kinds of material and spiritual pursuits, depending on the evolutionary state of this native.
</p><p><em>2nd Pada:</em> The second pada of the Moola Nakshatra comes in the Taurus Navamsa ruled by Venus. The focus here is on the study of the occult sciences. On the material plane, the natives will be very hard-working and will achieve all their aims.
</p><p><em>3rd Pada:</em> The third pada of the Moola Nakshatra falls in the Gemini Navamsa ruled by Mercury. Here the natives believe in jugglery of words, which helps them in great communication.
</p><p><em>4th Pada:</em> The fourth pada of the Moola Nakshatra falls in the Cancer Navamsa ruled by the Moon. The focus here is on the a non-stop struggle to relate with people around them on the emotional plane.</p><p><br></p><p><span style="font-size: 1rem;"><strong>Other aspects of this Nakshatra:&nbsp;</strong></span><br></p><p>The Purushardha (life's vector or motivation) is Kama. 
</p><p>Totem animal is Dog (male). 
</p><p>Symbol - a tail of lion or goad for elephants. 
</p><p>Devata (Deity) - Nirritti or Nairutti. 
</p><p>Dosha - Vata.
</p><p>
</p><p>This is the 19th Nakshatra of the zodiac, spanning from 00째-00' to 13째20' in the sign Dhanu. This is a Nakshatra owned by the node Ketu, the entire span of this Nakshatra falls in the sign Dhanu, owned by the auspicious planet Guru (Jupiter). While Guru is the planet of wisdom, Ketu indicates hard work or Tapasya. Hence the people born on this Nakshatra gain the wisdom and knowledge through their hard work. They have their own set of principles to live by.
</p><p>
<span style="font-size: 1rem;">Natives born on this Nakshatra are tall and have a good physical appearance. They are peace loving personalities, but will not hesitate to fight for what rightfully belongs to them. It is widely believed that a Moola born person becomes harmful to his/her parents. This is because the meaning of the word, Moola means the root. Hence the perception that a Moola born is harmful to his/her parents. But this is largely unjustified. A valuable piece of material lost on this Nakshatra will be found out by its owner, as the word Moola also means 'getting back to the square one'.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 1rem;">These people are good advisers. These people have multiple skills and hence, change of professions is a regular feature for these people. They are also good advisers and act as consultants.&nbsp;</span><br></p><p><span style="font-size: 1rem;">Moola born are frequent spend thrifts, spending their money recklessly. But they do not resort to unfair means to earn money to support their expenditure. Moola people are also very devoted in their relations, be it friendship, marriage, partnership or employment. They are really devoted and continue with these relations even during the most trying times.&nbsp;</span><br></p><p><span style="font-size: 1rem;">Out of all the family relations, these people do not enjoy good equation with their parents, while their married life is more or less satisfactory.&nbsp;</span><br></p><p>
</p><p><strong>Male Natives
</strong></p><p><span style="font-size: 1rem;">1. Physical features: He has good physical appearance. He will have beautiful limbs and bright eyes. He will be the most attractive person in his family.&nbsp;</span><br></p><p><span style="font-size: 1rem;">2. Character and general events: He has a very sweet nature and is a peace loving person. He has a set principle in his life. There is a general fear about the persons born in Moola Nakshatra. It isn't like that always. He can stand against any adverse tidal wave. He has the capacity to penetrate that wave and reach the destination.&nbsp;</span><br></p><p><span style="font-size: 1rem;">He is not bothered about tomorrow nor he is very serious about his own matters. He keeps all the happenings in the hands of god and become prey to optimism.&nbsp;</span><br></p><p>
3<span style="font-size: 1rem;">. Education, sources of earning/profession: He does not keep control of the balance of receipt and payment resulting in debt. He is the type of person who renders advice to others but not capable of keeping the same principles for his own use. This peculiar characteristic generally fits them for the profession of financial advise or religious advice.&nbsp;</span></p><p>
S<span style="font-size: 1rem;">ince he is skilled in several fields there will be frequent changes of profession or trade but stability in this direction seems to be a very rare phenomenon. Because of this inherent quality of frequent changes he is always in need of money. Moola born have a peculiar characteristic of mixing with his friends. It is quite natural that when expenditure is more than income and the native is not ready to earn anything by illegal mode the balance will always be in the negative. Hence it is advisable that he must keep away such friends and while he believes that all that is taking place on the earth is due to the blessings of HE, he should also try to be a little selfish and find a way to improve the inflow of income.&nbsp;</span></p><p>
O<span style="font-size: 1rem;">ut of all the 28 Nakshatras, I have come to a conclusion that these are the people who devote their entire energy with utmost sincerity to their employers as also to any persons who have kept faith or trust in Moola born. A deep study of the life of these persons has revealed some facts about their separate entity than other Nakshatra born i.e. some sort of internal force or some external force is briefing the natives in all the work they undertake.&nbsp;</span></p><p>
H<span style="font-size: 1rem;">e earns his livelihood in a foreign place. It is advisable that he must, as far as possible, try to get an opportunity either in the professional field or in the business field in a foreign land or country as he cannot have good luck in the native place; whereas he can have much better success in a foreign land.&nbsp;</span></p><p>
A<span style="font-size: 1rem;">s already mentioned above, he is capable of shining in all walks of life, particularly i the field of fine arts, as a writer and in the social work.&nbsp;</span></p><p>
4<span style="font-size: 1rem;">. Family life: Excepting a few cases, it is seen that Moola born cannot have any benefit from his parents whereas he is all self-made. His married life will be more or less satisfactory. He gets a spouse with all the requisite qualities expected from a good wife.&nbsp;</span></p><p>
<span style="font-size: 1rem;">5. Health: Probable problems he will be affected with are tuberculosis, isnofelia, paralytic attack or stomach problem. Whatever may be the nature of disease it will not be visible in his appearance or face as even when he is critically ill, his expression and the attraction of the face will not change. Normally it is seen that the native is not in the habit of taking care of his own health. With the result, some severe health problems can be noticed in his 27th, 31st, 44th, 48th, 56th and 60th age.&nbsp;</span></p><p>
<span style="font-size: 1rem;">Once he is addicted to any drug it will be very difficult to control such addiction. Hence it must try to keep away from any material of intoxication.&nbsp;</span></p><p>
</p><p><strong>Female Native
</strong></p><p><span style="font-size: 1rem;">1. Physical features: Medium complexion - neither black nor white or swarthy in hot countries. Reddish color in cold countries. Her principal teeth will not be close with great distance, wealthy sign.&nbsp;</span><br></p><p><span style="font-size: 1rem;">2. Character and general events: Mostly these natives are pure-hearted. However, obstinacy cannot be ruled out. Even on small matters she will be very much adamant. Since she lacks knack of dealing she quite often lands into problems.&nbsp;</span><br></p><p><span style="font-size: 1rem;">3. Education, sources of earning/profession: Mostly, Moola born females do not acquire much education. These females don't show any interest in studies. Most of these females spent more than two terms in the same standard or class. Ultimately they leave further education. The only exception is that if Jupiter is placed in opposition i.e. aspects or placed in Magha Nakshatra, the native may be a doctor or employed in an envious position i.e. such females will have excellent academic record and reach to the top.&nbsp;</span><br></p><p><span style="font-size: 1rem;">4. Family life: Females born in this Nakshatra, unlike the males, cannot enjoy full conjugal bliss. she will have a separated life, mainly due to the death of her husband or divorce. This result cannot be blindly applied as other planetary positions of favorable nature will, blindly applied as other planetary positions of favorable nature will, to a certain extent, nullify the bad effects. There may be delay in the marriage and also some hurdles. If the position of Mars is unfavorable she will have to face a lot of problems either from her husband or from children.&nbsp;</span><br></p><p><span style="font-size: 1rem;">5. Health: She is prone to rheumatism, lumbago, hip or back ache combined with pain in arms and shoulders.</span><br></p><p>
